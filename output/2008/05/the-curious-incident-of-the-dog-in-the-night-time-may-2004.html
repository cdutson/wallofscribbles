        <blockquote>
<p>Chapters in books are usually given the cardnial numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6
and so on. But I have decided to give my chapters prime numbers
2,3,5,7,11,13 and so on because I like prime numbers.<br />
 Excerpt from The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The novel (the title is far too long to write for me) revolves around
the near-normal life of Christopher John Francic Boone, who goes to a
special school because he is different. One day he wakes up to find out
that the neighbors dog has been killed with a pitchfork. Since he likes
detectives like Sherlock Holmes, he decides to investigate into the
murder. This is just one of the many facets that are explored throughout
the book, and it really helps explore the world from a very different
point of view.</p>
<p>The main character and psudo-author Christopher is, as far as my
non-medical mind can tell, autistic. He can knows every prime number to
7,057, cannot stand being touched, register peoples facial expressions,
or tell jokes. He has special needs and suffers from a certain level of
Obsessive Compulsive Order as well if I could make the call. I've never
read anything like it, and I'm glad that I have. Christopher has a way
of taking ordinary things such as taking the train, and turns them into
adventures full of strife and personal accomplishment. Things that are
totally ordinary to us are giant stone walls that he has to overcome in
order to figure things out.</p>
<p>Mark Haddon really seems to be channeling Douglas Coupland in this book.
I know I shouldn't compare the two because they are indeed different
writers with different styles. What I am getting at is that there is a
creativity in this book that I'd usually reserve for Coupland. It's a
refreshing change from the standard fare in the market, and I'm glad
someone is stepping into the ring. I'm certain Mr. Haddon will go on to
become a favorite to many, myself included.</p>
<p>The only real complaints I have about the book are:</p>
<p>It seems to end pretty suddenly, with the last chapters acting more like
a montage than a proper ending. It pains me when authors rush endings of
their books.</p>
<p>Sometimes the fact that Christopher doesn't really have much in the ways
of a writing prowess, the book can deviate and get somewhat drawn out
with facts that have been established. Yes the train is loud and hurts
your head. you don't need paragraphs about it.</p>
<p>Other than those two points, it's a solid book that I would recommend to
anyone.</p>
<p>P.S. I love his <a href="http://www.markhaddon.com/" title="Mark Haddon">website</a>; I
am sad that he hasn't updated his blog in almost a year though.</p>
