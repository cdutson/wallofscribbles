            <p>I've played a lot of videogames in my time. Not as many as some, but
I've been playing console games since I was 3 (at least that's as far
back as I can remember). I've played Sega Master System games, I've
played old 386 PC games, I've played my share of SNES, Playstation,
Gamecube, etc. etc. I've played a whole lot of 'em. But one thing I've
never really done is played a collection of games all the way through
their storyline. I was never good enough at Ultima Underworld, my
computer couldn't handle Warcraft 3, Starcraft 2, or the recently
released Diablo III. Hell, even IPs that exist for the ...</p>

is a strange one for me. I started off by, quite frankly, disliking it.
I went off about how playing through the game in single-player would be
a chore, and so the only time I would actually play it would be at my
friends house. Preferably only after a decent amount of drinking.
Nothing really struck me as truly amazing about it, and whined that the
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BakS1TcIKuk" title="Youtube.com - The original Borderlands trailer">original
version</a>
would have been so much cooler/more epic/a better RPG/whatever the hell

<p>It's silly, I know, but I have a problem with brain teasers. I can't put
them down without getting really angry at myself for giving up. I will
constantly think about the problem until I've answered it. It's really
quite unhealthy. So what do you think happens when I come across a game

nothing less than vivid and unnerving. The Doctor goes to investigate

Chronovores. The plan goes to hell and a new creature ...</p>

is very much like the original, but with a few added tricks. Released in
North America January of 2007, Current fans salivated over the new game.
Featuring slightly improved graphics, - maybe I'm nuts but I don't
recall moving mouths in the first game - slightly better music, an
expanded cast, and a new feature to aggravate the player, Justice For
All provides hours of entertaining Lawyer-y fun.</p>
<p>The downside to the game right off the bat is that there are only four
cases, unlike the original version which had five. Other than that, this
game features many subtle improvements that should not be overlooked.

<p>In any case, the music coming through my speakers from this album had a
different-but-same feel as the first one. I've come to the conclusion
that Tommy Walter has a personal beef with societies current bell-curve.
I'm not here to say whether he is right or wrong but I will say that his
music, and each song in themselves, contains strong emotion and focus on
their message(s). In the end, the CD tends to have somewhat of a darker
feel to it ...</p>
