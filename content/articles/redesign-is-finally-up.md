I've spent every spare moment over the last two weeks making this
design, which I've dubbed "blocks."

As for some technical things, I made this design using a grid, 980 to be
precise. the design itself is actually, 940 pixels wide, though that's
because my fireworks file has a 20 pixel gutter on the sides, which you
can't really notice in this design.

I only use one font throughout the entire site (Arial). This is usually
a bit of a no-no but I went with it, and made sure that all my headings
were differentiated from the content. I also made sure my line-spacing
was tall enough so that the body text didn't become hard to read.

I've moved most of my former pages into lists found in the footer. I
decided that this website was about what I write, and so having those
extra pages wasn't worth it, nor are they main focus of this site.

The left bar is widget-driven, with the exception of the calendar which
is always there.

The top four panels will change the site's colours using jQuery.

Now for things that I know are messed up:

1.  **PNGImages seem to be resizing weird in ie6.** Seems to have
    something to do with the [pngFix jQuery
    library](http://jquery.andreaseberhard.de/pngFix/ "jquery.pngFix.js")
    I'm using. I will be looking into this.
2.  **The Left nav can over-lap the footer on ie6.** I'm not fixing this
    because I'm sick of ie6, and I had to make enough concessions in my
    design just to make it work. As far as I'm concerned it's a hit I'm
    willing to take. Upgrade people.
3.  **The resume and portfolio links go to a coming soon page** (my
    next projects)
4.  **Old posts have some content repeated.** This is due to my taking
    advantage of the Excerpt in this design more than the old one. I've
    got to go back through the old posts and update them. Not looking
    forward to it.
5.  **Some posts contain images that mess the layout up.** Once again
    I've got to go through those posts and update the sizes. As I'm
    using a smaller content column, I've got to update all those posts.
    Also not looking forward to that.
6.  I've still got to test it, but I think there could be a **bug with
    the OpenID plugin with this layout.** (comment section)
7.  <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">**When logged in
    ie7 (only) the Submit button for comments is behind the
    text box.**</span>

And with this out of the way, we'll see how my schedule adjusts.
