I finished the book with the same feeling that I've felt after reading
every other new adventure story so far (Winner Takes All, The Clockwise
Man, The Stone Rose, The Art of Destruction, and The Nightmare of Black
Island): Typical. The Clockwise is a possible exception, but not by
much. All these stories, though good, seem like they were rejects for
the show for simply not exhibiting enough strength. They're not bad by
any means and I enjoyed each of them in differing ways. What I am saying
is that I have yet to read a new adventures that can compare to the old
series.

Maybe it's unfair to compare these novels to the likes of "The Shadows
of Avalon," "Blue Angel" and the "Interference" duet. The problem is
that it's generally hard when you've read so many of them. I figure that
they are toning these first ones down to help appeal to the younger
audience, and I can respect that. What I would like is just something
with a bit more soul. I've read books that have permanently changed the
way I view the Doctor. None of the new ones have come close to that.
They all seem like we're watching the surface fa√ßade of his character.
The Price of Paradise is no exception to the rule, which disappointed me
somewhat.

It is a well-written story, and I would totally suggest it for teaching
literary practice, for a class to read, or to introduce Doctor Who
novels to someone. That's about it though. There is no foreshadowing, no
deep secrets brought to light that we didn't already know about.

6/10.
