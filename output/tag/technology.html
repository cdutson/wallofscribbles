<a href="http://graphicriver.net/?ref-Corey%20Dutson" title="GraphicRiver.net">GraphicRiver</a>,
a forum thread came up that basically outlined the following:
"<strong><em>PHOTOSHOP IS SO SLOW WHY GOD WHY?</em></strong>" In further investigation the
author did admit he had some aging hardware, which really should be
addressed.</p>
<p>For those of us - myself included - that cannot simply afford to drop

out there doesn't know about what I'm talking about yet. I've been using
<a href="http://www.getdropbox.com/" title="Get Dropbox">Dropbox</a> since the last day

<p>Regardless, since using

it does everything <em>perfectly</em>. If ever you could have a backup system

enjoying it thoroughly. It works fairly well, It's shiny, I can now play
games from my bed, it treats me nicely. I know a lot of people will hate
on me for getting a 360, what with the red ring of death issue, blah
blah blah. I'll say now that the Wii needs elbow room, the PS3 has
absolutely nothing on it that I want to play (that's a lie, Little Big

            <p>So where to begin? I've started school, though it's only frosh week so
that doesn't count. I'm liking <a href="http://www.mohawkcollege.ca/homepage.html" title="Mohawk Collge">Mohawk

than <a href="http://www.conestogac.on.ca/" title="Conestoga College">Conestoga</a> in
terms of the faculty. Not that
<a href="http://www.conestogac.on.ca/" title="Conestoga College">Conestoga</a>'s was bad,
but the staff at
<a href="http://www.mohawkcollege.ca/homepage.html" title="Mohawk Collge">Mohawk</a>
really seem to give a damn. These teachers actually seem to want to help
me out, especially since I've been working on switching from one stream
to another. The campus (Brantford - Elgin) feels like a high school for
grown ups - I said the same about
<a href="http://www.conestogac.on.ca/" title="Conestoga College">Conestoga</a> - and I've
come to the decision that colleges must look like bigger high schools.
Only Universities can have shiny arty architecture, and nice stuff.</p>
