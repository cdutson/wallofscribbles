On June 11th, 2015, my wife powered through the delivery of our daughter, Scarlett. I'm not going to go into detail as to the birth itself, other than to say that my wife did an absolutely amazing job. Truly an amazing experience to be a part of, and I could not be more proud of her.

I knew raising a brand new person was going to be hard. I really did know that before we started. However knowing something _in theory_ and then knowing it _in practice_ are very, very different things. You think I would have learned that the difference between theoretical knowledge and practical application from my time before ever having sex with anyone.

Eh, I'm a slow learner, apparently.

It turns out that raising a child is really fucking difficult.

I've decided that my now being a parent finally opens the door to being able to write about such things. I admit I've only been a parent for a month or so now, but that doesn't mean I can't be full if opinions on the matter. To be honest I just want to put something out there that isn't all fluff and joy. Parenting kinda sucks, and no one really tells you that before you begin.

So with that said, the following is a list in absolutely no order whatsoever of my experiences thus far of having a child. This is post is half-complaint, and half-advice. If you want to jump to the only real piece of advice / the only really up setting part in this post, [click here](#breaking-point).

## Diapers, bodily fluids, and other such things

It is crazy how quickly you stop caring about such things. Poop on your finger? baby-wipe and move on. Kid threw-up all over you? It'll dry. Baby peed all over you while you were changing her? Whatever.

Seriously, it's nuts how quick you stop caring.

## Sleep deprivation

Everyone jokes about how tired you'll be when you have a new-born. _Everyone._ They're right, of course. Lack of sleep isn't anything new in regard to child rearing. What I didn't know was just how much that dedicated lack of sleep was going to suck. I've done lack of sleep before. At my time at Concept, I had pulled a 50 hour work day. To clarify, I went to work Monday, and left some time on Wednesday. I slept for a couple hours in the middle using my shoes as a pillow. What I'm saying is that I generally handle sleep deprivation pretty well... in small, isolated doses. For the last month or so, I've been whittled down to at best 6 hours of interrupted sleep. It's generally closer to 5. Every day, this is what I get.

That really starts to wear you down. It makes you irritable; it makes you dumb; it makes you lethargic. Unfortunately your baby doesn't give _a single shit_ about any of that, and that just adds to your exhaustion. It's a vicious cycle.

Try and nap when your child naps. It's what I keep telling my wife, and she's been managing so far. I on the other hand am an idiot who cannot nap to save his life. This means that I get to be tired most of the time.

## Invest in hearing protection

You think I'm joking. _**I am not joking.**_ I have what I call "undiagnosed tinnitus" which is exactly what you'd think it is. Years of going to concerts without hearing protection have left me constantly hearing 3-4 tones all the time. A non-stop ringing. They're not loud, but they are there.

When my child gets to screaming, those tones get amplified, and my ears will start to hurt. She's loud when she's hungry, or when she's gassy, or pretty much any time she feels like having a cry. In the evenings I basically wear my Bose in-ear headphones all the time. Nothing has to be playing from them, but they muffle things just enough to take the edge off.

Chances are your hearing isn't as busted as mine is, and if that's the case: good for you! Way to take care of your hearing, you bastard(s). Regardless, I suggest investing in headphones, ear plugs, or whatever. You're going to hear a lot of screaming, so anything you can do to help yourself cope will be an absolute godsend.

## Babies are ungrateful little creatures

Babies are assholes by design. It's true. They're ungrateful little tyrants that do nothing but make noise and work for their parents. If they didn't constantly demand your attention, you might fall asleep and then they'd die because you didn't feed them or whatever for 8 hours.

Babies do not give a _single shit_ about what you're doing, and that's frustrating as all hell. You need to go to the bathroom? That's the perfect time to start screaming at the top of their lungs. You want to eat something? Fuck that, you have to carry baby around for 40 minutes until they fall asleep. You wanted to go out somewhere? Good-goddamned-luck. Babies don't care about _your_ schedule.

Let's not forget that babies are fickle creatures. My wife and I do our best to make sure that our child is fed properly, burped as well as possible, kept clean and warm. Despite this, our child likes to just scream sometimes. Sometimes for well over an hour. Apparently this could be gas, but it doesn't matter. Put a screaming child next to _your_ ear for an hour and see how sympathetic you feel towards them.


## So long, spontaneity

Shortly after my daughter was born, I was tasked by my wife to go to Toys R Us to get some more swaddling blankets. Having only given birth a week prior she was in no state, mentally or physically, to make the journey herself. I had no problem with jumping on my bike and heading over.

I got there, bought the blankets, debated some food-court food (which I opted to decline), and headed back home. I didn't want to leave Theresa without support for any longer than I had to.

As I was locking up my bike, a realization hit me: We can't do things anymore. More specifically, my wife and I cannot decide to do anything on a whim anymore.  There was a time in the not-to-distant past where we could message a couple friends, and within half an hour have a picnic lined up and spend the afternoon in a park making merry. That's gone now. I knew it would happen, but it's weird to think it, and then to actually _realize_ it.

There is a comedian, Michael McIntyre, who has a skit regarding having children. It's very funny, and you should take a moment and [have a watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFQfylQ2Jgg).

> Persona 1: Shall we leave the house?
>
> Persona 2: Yes.
>
> \*mimes two people walking out the front door\*

It's funny, but very true. My wife and I can only do things when they can be planned well in advance. Hell, this early on, there's basically nothing we can do. Our child requires feeding and changing too often, and the stares we would get from those without children when our daughter inevitably cries are simply too much to handle.

## <a id="breaking-point"></a> The struggle is real: hitting your breaking point

Okay I kind of lied up top. I've left this one to last, because it's the only serious one in the list. Well, okay, The other ones are real, but not _real_ real.

If you read about "how to be a new parent" eventually you'll come across the only piece of advice I can honestly say is worth telling others: **It's okay to walk away from your child when you become too frustrated.** If there is one thing I will obnoxiously tell all new parents I come across, this is gonna be it. Everything else you can figure out, but this? This one piece of advice is gold.

What the parenting blogs don't talk about is what 'frustration' means. I am going to talk about what it means to me. My wife has had a similar but unique experience that I cannot give justice to by discussing on her behalf. All I can do is talk about how I felt when I was at the end of my rope.

So here's what happened:

Around day 10 or 11 (time is just a loose concept to me at this point, so I'm kind of guessing) at around 11:30 at night, I was on minute 40 of my child screaming. She was fed and cleaned and warm and everything, but she was screaming bloody murder. There I was walking in circles while holding her,  headphones in and music cranked just trying to drown her out. It was awful. Nothing I did helped, which was frustrating because I am a fixer: I like to look at problems and find solutions.

Babies are not problems with straight-forward answers. Sometimes they scream and you are utterly hopeless in the situation. Buckle up, because you're just along for this awful ride.

So there I am, pacing around trying to sooth my daughter, when from out of nowhere the following thought pops into my head: **I completely understand why people shake their babies.** It's an awful thought. Fucking _terrible,_ really. I didn't want to think it, it just happened. This was when I realized I needed to walk away for a minute.

So that's exactly what I did. I placed my daughter in her crib, walked out of the room (headphones trailing behind me) and told me wife, and I quote: **"I'm done. I'm out. You've gotta go in there because I just can't right now. I can't."**

Not my proudest moment, but I know I'm not alone in this. Thousands of other parents have had a similar experience, I know they have. It doesn't really make me feel less bad about it, but at least I know I'm not alone in my exasperation. There are a lot of parents who have had similar thoughts and unfortunately acted upon them.

**To be clear:** I don't condone their actions in any way; to harm a baby or child under your care is deplorable. However having been in that moment myself, I can at least say that I _empathize_ with them. It's still a terrible thing to do, but _I get it._

See, what people don't tell you is that you're going to break at some point. It's not an 'if,' it's a 'when.' _It's going to happen._  When it does happen, you're going to feel terrible after. I'm here to say _it's okay._ You're not a bad parent for having those thoughts (whatever yours happens to be), and don't bother beating yourself up about it. You're exhausted, you're frustrated, and you just can't make your kid feel better. It's a horrible situation, and you flagged for a second. You'll probably do it more than once. It's okay, _it happens._ Just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and take a breath. Oh, and for the love of god, don't hurt your child.

## So how are you doing, champ?

After three weeks, I'm already way better at handling her evening scream. I've learned to accept my reality, which is kind of fucked up if you think about it. Regardless, I've been able to brace myself and accept the situation with a lot more calm since my little freakout. She's still loud, and it still sucks, but I'm handling it a lot better.

If I can power through it, you can as well. Trust me.

Raising a kid is fucking difficult, and I've only just begun.

Do you know what's funny, though? I've my wife recently went away with our child for a couple days, and I found myself missing them. Like, not missing them a little; but counting-the-hours-until-they-were-home-again levels of missing. It's kind of crazy that this same sleep-ruining, stress-inducing, frustration machine is what was generating such a desire to hold her again.

That's probably parenting in a nutshell, if you think about it. Your kid gives you nothing but grief, and you love them anyways.
