The gist is this: You can tell the browser how to render your web page.
I'm aware that that's how it should be working from the get go, but as
we learned with the IE7 chaos that this is not the case. Microsoft's
solution is a simple meta-tag that you would add to your markup which
would allow your website to tell the browser (IE8) to act like IE7 or
IE6 or whatever version your site looked pretty in. This is great if
you're a lazy markup-writer, or cannot honestly be bothered with
updating your website in any shape, way, or form. I can see the merit,
truly I can. It's a total cop-out with the whole "continuous
improvement" idea that mankind is always raving about, but who really
needs that? A part of me is a real fan of this idea based solely on past
experiences with styling in IE.

Now granted, you can tell your website to stay on the cutting edge of IE
rendering by using the "edge" keyword (see what I did there?) in your
meta-tag . This will allow your website to be rendered at whatever the
end users version of IE is. I like the idea of targeting a website to
certain browsers, especially when you work in a web development position
where part of the statement of work is a section dedicated to what
browsers your work has to run in. This sort of idea makes my job as a
website stylist that much easier. Unfortunately, I am opposed to the
idea in the end.

The problem lays not in the fact that you can target browser version,
it's the fact that it's gotten to this point. It's a depressing thing to
think about really; had Microsoft just done things right the first time
(or at the very least come out with hot fixes to make the needed
changes) we wouldn't be in this mess to begin with. People are always
complaining about IE, more so since browsers like Firefox have stepped
into the ring. I'm aware that Firefox is not perfect, but that's not
what I'm arguing. Firefox, along with the other browsers, took far more
time to correct CSS bugs than IE ever did. Only now with the eventual
release of IE 8 are we looking at IE possibly coming up par.

I don't work on the team, and I'm truly glad I don't. These guys are
basically the internet pariah group of the century. Everyone can hate IE
with little to no effort due to its historic record of screwing up
websites. I'm glad to see that they're working so hard to get the
browser up to speed on the compliance front, as well as trying to make
it easier for everyone. Sadly, by making it easier for everyone they
really hurt further progression in the field.

Allowing HTML writers to slap a version on their site and let it be
that, you stifle the drive to improve their craft. You allow the user to
literally say "good 'nuff" to their work, and since the Web isn't going
away anytime soon, I shudder to think of what will become of the next
generation of web designers. It's going to be the Geocities site builder
circa 1997 all over again.

I guess it would at least look the same in every browser, so that's
something. In the end I'm against the idea from a progression
standpoint, but I have to admit - if not begrudgingly - that at least
this would stop sites from breaking every release. It's gross, but it'd
work.

P.S.
