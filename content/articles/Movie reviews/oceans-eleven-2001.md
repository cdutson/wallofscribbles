Yeah, I'm aware the movie came out some time ago, but I only just got to
see it on the weekend. Yes, I am aware that the odds of my being unable
to watch a movie that is over 5 years old is somewhat of a stretch, but
let's pretend I was busy. Every day. For five years. Well okay, six
years.

Shutup.

Anyways, it stars a fuck-load of actors whom you can look up a list of
yourself. I'm not going to list out all majillion of them. Suffice it to
say they were actually on their A-game for this one.

I have not seen the original Ocean's Eleven, but I am sure this movie is
no disgrace to it. Filled with stunning acting, witty writing, and more
class then I'm used to in a movie... this was a grand departure from
what has rolled into and out of the theaters since its time. Noted
exceptions of course, but I'm playing the averages.

Special notice must be given to Pitt and Clooney's private scenes. I
really don't know how long it took them to get those down, but they all
seemed so natural, it was almost creepy. They were done with a simple
elegance and air of cool knowledge of their characters that just can't
not (yes, a double negative!) make you smile. I was never a big fan of
Clooney, what with the only other role I've seen him is was Batman,
which I won't talk about here (or ever) left a bad taste in my mouth. I
think I shall have to start giving him more of a chance.

Overall I was fully entertained, and I will go with the old "Better late
then never" saying on this one. Had I never watched it, I would be doing
myself a disservice.

8.4/10
