            <p>I'm not an Apple fanboy. Truly I'm not. Now that said, I have a macbook,
an iPad, and an iPhone that I have through my current workplace. By all
accounts, one would think that I am a total fanboy. I mean, I own pretty
much one of their everything. I'll even go on to say that I really,
<em>really</em> enjoy their products; I like the iPhone/iPad interactions, I
enjoy the iterations of their OS, and I appreciate the aesthetic of
their products.</p>
<p>I have never been a total fan though. At the end of the day, they are
tools that I use to get things done throughout my day. I don't hold them

            <p>I'm a huge fan of stories. I really am. I read <a href="http://www.robertmunsch.com/books.cfm?bookid=48" title="Robert Munsch - Good Families Don't">my first
book</a>
before I was in school. I read my first novel by grade 2. I was reading
Tolkien by grade 4. I have a book shelf that I bought because my
original one was two books deep on every shelf. I've become a huge fan
of Podcasts like <a href="http://www.themoth.org/" title="The Moth - Stories Told Live Without Notes">The
Moth</a>
and <a href="http://www.waywardirregular.com/" title="The Wayward Irregular">The Wayward

to the magic that comes from them. I will listen to any and everyone
that has a story to tell. All the more when they've got a flair for "the

            <p>It's been a long, long time since I've played any <em>real</em> arcade-style
games. Last time I picked up a controller to play any sort of
side-scrolling, button-bashing, streets-of-fury style game I was a much
younger person. With SNES controller in hand, my friend and I playing
the likes of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_in_time" title="Wikipedia: Turtles In Time">TNMT: Turtles in

<p>See the problems with my playing these sorts of games are:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm no good at them.</li>
<li>I lack the toned fore-arm muscle of the veteran gamer.</li>
<li>I lacked a console.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well I <a href="/2009/01/06/360-degrees-of-failure/" title="Corey Dutson: 360 Degrees of Failure">now have a

out I still suck at ...</p>

            <p>I'm a little late with this, but the joy of the Internet is that someone
out there doesn't know about what I'm talking about yet. I've been using
<a href="http://www.getdropbox.com/" title="Get Dropbox">Dropbox</a> since the last day
of their private beta. As soon as I had invites to give, they went
public and my chance to look ahead of the curve went up in a tiny cloud
of blue smoke.</p>
<p>Regardless, since using
<a href="http://www.getdropbox.com/" title="Get Dropbox">Dropbox</a> I can only say that
it does everything <em>perfectly</em>. If ever you could have a backup system
for the lazy, the inexperienced, or the uninterested this would be it. I

            <p>I am not the first person to talk about this book, and I know damned
well that I won't be the last. That aside, I have little choice but to
talk about The Last Lecture. I meant to talk about the original online
version when I first saw it the day Randy Pausch died. I know it's
somewhat of a morbid coincidence, but it's true and I can't tell you how
heart-broken I was when I found out this tidbit of information.</p>

While looking around his site, I found what is deemed a "<a href="http://jarkkolaine.com/2007/07/26/never-work-overtime-again/" title="Mever Wprk Overtime Again">popular
article</a>".
The title alone got me to read it (Never Work Overtime Again) and after
reading it I can honestly say that he nailed it perfectly. Nothing could
be done to improve the statements made therein.</p>
<p>I can honestly attest to what he's saying, seeing as how I have worked
insane amount of overtime at my current place of work. The worst ...</p>

<p>Bethany, the world is a beautiful place. Life is short, and yet it's

 Excerpt from The Gum Thief</p>

<p>The synopsis is not something I can easily go through and so I shall
keep it short. Roger is a pathetic excuse for a man who is in his 40's
and working at Staples. Bethany is a girl who's a bit too old to be a
Goth with no real direction in life. She too works at Staples. They
connect through their writing each other notes. Nothing romantic in
them, but a connection is forged. And that is the simple yet stunning
basis of the book. From there it is a whirlwind ...</p>
