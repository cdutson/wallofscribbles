            <p>With my moving back to Canada soon at hand, I was forced with the
unfortunate reality that the time I had with my XBox 360 was quickly
drawing to a close. As such, I wanted to make sure I got through a
couple of my unfinished games before getting rid of the lovely thing.
I'm taking the harddrive back home with me, so it's only a temporary
hiatus. That said, one of the titles I opted to complete was Telltale's
<a href="http://www.thewalkingdead.com/" title="The Walking Dead official site">The Walking
Dead</a>.</p>
<p>I really should have thought about that before diving in. Everyone said
it was amazing and moving and sucked you in and sliced bread could learn
a thing or two from it and who ...</p>

            <p>I've played a lot of videogames in my time. Not as many as some, but
I've been playing console games since I was 3 (at least that's as far
back as I can remember). I've played Sega Master System games, I've
played old 386 PC games, I've played my share of SNES, Playstation,
Gamecube, etc. etc. I've played a whole lot of 'em. But one thing I've
never really done is played a collection of games all the way through
their storyline. I was never good enough at Ultima Underworld, my
computer couldn't handle Warcraft 3, Starcraft 2, or the recently
released Diablo III. Hell, even IPs that exist for the ...</p>

to say that they don't do good work, but their usual fare just isn't
something that I can enjoy for more than about 10 minutes. Grand Theft

personally achieve in it), and Red Dead Redemption just seemed like the
same thing, but with cowboys.</p>

            <p>You know, every time I have one of these impromptu hiatuses - hiatusi?
hiatusae? - I always try and recall just what caused me to stop posting.
It's not like I was posting every other day and got burnt out, no no, I
was posting once a week. But of course the cycle dies off and you end up
with what, a five month break in posts?</p>
<p>That's not kosher.</p>
<p>The irony is that if I had just managed to keep up with my weekly
posting, I would probably have a more complete list of things that I
have actually done. It's a self-defeating cycle of suck, and I seem to
really enjoy the ride. Never mind that I ...</p>

            <p>Wow, it's been a while since I've done a game review. Could be because
It's been a while since I've played a game through to completion. Sadly
I am finding it hard to make time to dedicate to playing games when
things like school and work are in the way. Pesky thing, responsibility.</p>
<p>Having said that, with my school giving me far too much time off over
the Christmas break, I managed to get my hands on a shiny new XBox 360.
Granted that was a <a href="/2009/01/06/360-degrees-of-failure/" title="Corey Dutson: 360 Degrees of Failure">bit of a
fiasco</a>,
in the end I landed me a couple of games. One of those games (obviously,
I think, at this point) was <a href="http://www.lucasarts.com/games/legoindianajones/" title="LucasArts: LEGO Indiana Jones">LEGO Indiana

            <p>I'll preface this by saying that since getting my XBox 360, I've been
enjoying it thoroughly. It works fairly well, It's shiny, I can now play
games from my bed, it treats me nicely. I know a lot of people will hate
on me for getting a 360, what with the red ring of death issue, blah
blah blah. I'll say now that the Wii needs elbow room, the PS3 has
absolutely nothing on it that I want to play (that's a lie, Little Big
Planet interests me greatly) and I don't feel like having to repeatedly
upgrade my computer just to play games that almost always come out for a
console. I'm ...</p>
