It's been a while since I've played an honest to God platform game. It's
not my usual bag, as it requires a skill set that is lacking in me.
These games generally consist of accurate timing, good aim, and good
reflexes. These are all things I lack, and so platformers tend to annoy
me to the point of non-playing.

I used to stay as far away from platformers as I could, given that my
ability in them scored somewhere in the negatives. Every time I would
try one, I'd get about 4 levels in, and then start to hate myself. It's
really not a pretty sight. Give me turn-based games and experiences
points, that's what I say!

Of course to every rule there is an exception, and Super Princess Peach
is, shockingly, one of those exceptions.<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->



Synopsis
--------

Like all Super Mario games (and all Mario game spin-offs) the story is
fairly straight-forward. Bowser has opted this time to capture Mario and
Luigi in lieu of the Princess. I can only assume that he did this so
that he could actually have a chance at ruling over the LSD-enabling
countryside. Of course, Peach decides to step up and prove that breasts
are no reason not to kick the shit out of Bowser.

Of course you have to go around correcting the entire countryside first.
'Cause you know, that's just how these games roll.

The game operates on the basic level-trolling principles that have
worked so well in the previous incarnations, with a couple twists. On
top of going through all 48 levels (40, excluding boss fights) you can
also find toads, who are lost in the worlds. You can also find
mini-games, music notes (which allow you to listen to songs in the game
menu), and spend your money in The Shop.

That's right, there's only one shop. Dude much be loaded.

Mechanics
---------

Super Princess Peach introduces a couple unique aspects to the
platform-genre that really tickle my fancy. Peach, given that she is a
princess, is genetically more robust than her Italian pipe-cleaner.
Here's a quick run-down of her genetic enhancements:

-   ***Happiness***: Peach gets so damned happy that she starts to float
    in a cyclone. An added benefit is that you can actually fly with
    this ability, so if you're like me and prone to cliff jumping, you
    can save your ass. There are limitations to this ability such as
    active flying eats away at your "Flow" - Magic, to the rest of the
    world - and there are certain points where you will be unable to
    fly, forcing you to rethink your strategy.
-   ***Sadness***: Peach defies all known physical facts, and starts
    crying our geysers from her eyes. If you've ever seen a kids
    [anime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime "Wikipedia: Anime") where
    a girl cries waterfalls, you know what this looks like. Added perks
    to this mode are running like a bat out of hell, and watering plants
    into massive vine-trees of doom. There are points in the game that
    require you to use this ability, and quickly.
-   ***Anger***: Channeling all those times that Peach's father (does
    she even have parents?) never gave her that jewel-encrusted pony,
    Peach turns into the Human Tourch. She walks slowly, stomps the
    ground whenever she jumps (good for knocking everyone on their ass),
    and nothing can touch you. Stomping, like flying, eats up more magic
    when used. Also, fire and wood don't mix.
-   ***Joy***: Not to be mistaken for happiness, Joy heals the Princess,
    so long as she doesn't get assauted by any enemies. This mode simply
    transforms magic into health. Good when you are in dire need
    of life. This mode is automatically turned off when enemies hit you,
    but not when you pick up/consume them.

These abilities add to the game by providing obvious puzzle elements
(fire can light lanterns, water make plants grow, wind makes smoke
dissipate, etc. etc.), as well as giving the user a couple more options
in dealing with situations.

I mentioned earlier the term "Flow". Flow is, as previously stated, your
magic bar. Your magical umberella can consume enemies to refill your
magic bar, or you can find gems to do the same thing. This allows you to
decide whether to bathe in the blood of your enemies, or just flat out
consume them wholly. Morbid when you really sti and think about it.

Oh yes, did I mention you have a magical umberella? Yes apparently a
little boy was transformed into a magical umberella, and through certain
happenstances, landed in the hands of Princes Peach. Peach uses this
umberella for a variety of things including, but not limited to: Bashing
enemies, consuming enemies, floating in the air, coasting in water, and
throwing things around. She really has no regard for the poor umberella,
which leads me to think that Princess Peach strongly believes in the
caste system.

Bitch.

Overall
-------

Overall, it's actually a pretty solid play through. The nice/terrible
part is that after you've beat the game the first time through, you are
given 3 new levels (per section, so 24 more levels) that you can access
by defeating all of the bosses, excluding Bowser, a second time. It
doesn't matter if you've beaten them 100 times, once you've defeated
Bowser, you have to go back and fight the other bosses to unlock the
additional levels. In order to find everything in the game (music notes,
mini games, etc) you have to play all of the original levels twice (once
before and after pre-game) as well as the 24 new levels. If you add it
all up, that's a total of 119 levels of play. *That's a lot of game
play* for a DS game.

I mostly enjoyed this game, though I could go my entire gaming life
without ever having to do another underwater mario level. I hate those
levels simply because you drift, and gernally this means you drift into
things that want to kill you. Also, you can't use your abilities while
under water. Keep that in mind.

It's not overly difficult, and the learning curve is basically spelled
out for you. Just take it one level at a time, and upgrade as you go
along. The more Flow you have, the better off you'll be. Other than
that, just enjoy the game for what it is: A cheerful, straight-forward
platforming game. No mind-bending puzzles, no cryptic under/overtones,
just a smiling peach beating the hell out of the native population. A
game that you can turn on, play through a 4 minute level, and then turn
off. Lends itself heavily towards small bursts rather than long-haul
style game play.

Cute, straight-forward, and with enough originality to give it some
flare.

7/10
