I recently got into a bit of an argument with a man on twitter.

That actually does sound as stupid as I thought I would, having written
it down. Regardless, I got into an argument with him over the topic
of feminism. He described himself as 'anti-feminist' and this was the
only thing in his twitter profile, so I really should have known better.

In our longer than I'm proud to admit ... well, let's call it a
discussion, I learned a couple things. This post is part rant, part
debate primer, and part personal declaration. Before you read on though,
I'm going to give a quick warning: this is probably way heavier than
anything else you'll read on my site. It's rare I post stuff like this.
Ye be warned, etc. etc.


<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->


First, if you're ever going to get into an argument, make sure you don't
do any of the following: [Ad
hominem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem "Wikipedia - Ad Hominem")
/ [Pro
hominem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_hominem "Wikipedia - Pro Hominem").
There are loads of other debate tips, but if you were ever going to take
one from me making sure you don't do those are an easy way to sound (and
actually be) way more credible. Reviewing his posts against other people
(mostly women) shows that he would goad them into attacking him from an
emotional standpoint and then  he would take the high road. He is
playing a game of emotional chicken with people when he argues, and most
of the time he's not the one who blinks first. Ironically, he falls for
the same tactics.

My first point is that when you argue a position, make sure you attack
points and defences, not the person making them. This guy attempted to
get a rise out of me by calling me a feminist puppet, that I had
feminist overseers, that I'd be singing falseto, etc. I opted to
maintain my combat against the points he put forward, and not at his
character (limited though I figured it probably was). This screwed him
up pretty fast.

Second, for anyone (on either side of the debate) who claims that
feminism is trying to:

1.  make women the domenant sex in society
2.  take away male rights
3.  Peg women as the superior sex
4.  attack that which makes 'us' 'men'
5.  some other crazy bullshit

You are *wrong*. Feminism (at it's core) is about getting women onto
equal footing with men in every arena. This means that they be judged
based on their ability, and not on their sexual organs. This means that
they would receive the same pay as a man doing the same job. This means
removing gender bias.

***That's it.*** That's feminism. *Making women equal to men*. If you
meet identified feminists that claim it's anything else? They've got it
wrong. If you meet guys who don't think it's this, then they've got it
wrong as well. Simple.

So during this exchange, I was identifying as a feminist, because
equality is something I believe in. I'm a white male, but because I
believe that women should be judged on ability, and not on gender, I'm a
feminist, and Just so you know: I'm totally okay with that.

This man argued to give an example of when feminism has benefited 'MEN'.
I gave several generalised examples, unwilling to start handing out
specific instances because goddamnit this is on twitter. My main retort
was that it wasn't supposed to benefit men; it is supposed to  benefit
us all. He disagreed, stating that if it doesn't benefit him directly
why should he support it? Apparently female scientists contributing to
giving him a longer life somehow doesn't count. Nor did filling in the
ranks of the army, or opening up whole new commercial sectors. The list
goes on and on.

*Sigh*.

He then brought up a website: The Community of the Wrongly Accused (I'm
not linking to it directly, because goddamn there's a lot of hate speech
in there. Seriously it goes beyond gross and simply ends up being
depressing to witness). There you can find stories of men that have been
wrongfully accused/tried/convicted of rape, assault, or other terrible
things. The over-arching theme of his new argument is that laws aren't
written fairly and men suffer for it.

Here's a fun fact: I don't disagree with this point at all. There are
warped laws in the law system, and when it comes to things such as
assault (sexual or otherwise), the law, in many places, does favour
women. I agree this needs changing. It was done that way with the right
intentions, but with misguided aim. In trying to correct and protect,
they over-corrected and allow for some people to take advantage of a
system initially put in place to protect them. That is wrong, and they
should be punished.

But how can I be a feminist then? I agree that there are laws biased in
womens favour? That I feel that there are issues with sections of the
law that over-compensate for gender. The answer is simple: I'm not
actually a feminist.

I am, as it works out, an *equal opportunist*. My view is that all
people, regardless of sex, orientation, political view, religion,
ethnicity, or whatever else should be judged based on their actions and
merit, not on a singular, targetable aspect. This means that I disagree
with abortion restrictions, with gender-biased laws, unequal pay scales,
and god knows what else. I want a single test for fire personelle to
take, not a dude and a lady test. Why? Because if a guy has to pull
200kg body 100 feet, so should a women. That's the requirements of the
job. If less women can do it, that's just how that works. If a job
requires a lower center of gravity, chances are more women would get
that job due to how we are constructed. It's based on the requirements
of the job, not on the sex of the applicant.

Because of this, some times I'm a feminist, other times it makes me a
defender of men, sometimes it makes me a defender of black, white, every
shade in-between. If you believe people should be judged by their
actions and their ability, then you will end up having many labels added
and taken from you depending on the situation. That's all they are
though, labels.

I will argue in defence of which ever side is getting the short end of
the stick. In this recent exchange, I argued for women because they do
get the short end of the stick in many arenas; we as a society haven't
made it there yet. When it gets to gender-biased laws, I argue for men
when the laws are one-sided for women because it's an area in which they
get the short end of the stick. I'm against setting laws down defining
what a woman can and cannot do with their body. I'm also in defence of
practicing whatever religion you choose (if any) so long as it doesn't
hurt others. It's about equality, plain and simple.

Know what I would love to do though? What I'd really like? *I'd like not
to have to argue for any side*. I'd like to see a day when there is no
'short end' of any stick.

That's what I want, and you should to.
