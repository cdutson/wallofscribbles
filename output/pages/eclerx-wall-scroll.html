approached me on behalf of a client, asking if I could produce a wall
decoration for their new office space. I was provided a rough outline of
what the interior designers wanted, as well as some of the client
stipulations and overall theme.</p>
<p>This was an interesting project for me, because I was never really going
to see the finished product. I had to make sure everything was to spec.
but without ever seeing where it was going to end up. It's also the
first project that got me really sifting through stock city skyline
photography. I don't know if you've tried, but finding a good,
high-quality, in-focus shot of Mumbai, but I can assure you it isn't a
straight-forward endeavour.</p>
<p><a href="http://wallofscribbles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/wall-scroll-v1.jpg"><img alt="Part way
through" src="http://wallofscribbles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/wall-scroll-v1.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>My first step (after getting the spec.) was to talk to the printing
company that were going to be producing and installing the wall scroll.
We talked about their preferred delivery format, colour spacing, as well
as file scale. I had to make my PSB file (PSD couldn't cut it in the
end) work at 25% scale, and work in the CMYK scale they described. This
was good on one side because my computer wasn't going to melt, but a
problem because all of the photos I sourced were going to have to be of
the highest possible quality and resolution.</p>
<p>Working with the specifications given to me from the designers and the
printers, as well as my recently sourced photos, I started laying out my
document. I started by arranging my cities in a rough order to make sure
I wouldn't end up with bald patches in my composite skyline.</p>
<p><a href="http://wallofscribbles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/wall-scroll-v6a.jpg"><img alt="New map and
gridlines" src="http://wallofscribbles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/wall-scroll-v6a.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Once I was happy with the general layout of the cities, I started
masking the skylines... and masking... and masking. I spent days masking
out those cities. While other people were watching the Olympics, I was
staring at a different part of London. While countries competed, I was
blending them together.</p>
<p>I kept in close contact with the designers and the client to make sure I
wasn't going too far down any wrong paths. I ended up going through 7
overall iterations to end up at the end product. Some buildings were
added and removed, whole cities were swapped around, the background
changed a couple times, and there where many shades of blue tossed about
until we found the right one.</p>
<p><a href="http://wallofscribbles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/wall-scroll-v7.jpg"><img alt="The finished product, at a much smaller
scale" src="http://wallofscribbles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/wall-scroll-v7.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>In the end, the design went up without a hitch. The client loved it, the
designers loved it, and everyone was happy. I'm glad I got this job,
because it introduced me to a bunch of things that I hadn't yet
experienced as a freelance designer.</p>
<p>It was a definite learning experience that I won't soon forget.</p>
