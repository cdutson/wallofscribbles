        <h3>The Good</h3>
<p>They offer a wide variety of services, but they are mostly tied in
within the original scope of the site. A brief rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Profile management - a staple.</li>
<li>Private Messaging - another staple.</li>
<li>My Quotes - Quote you've found that you enjoy.</li>
<li>My Writing - A neat way of getting your writing out there. You
    maintain the copyright to anything you write, and it collects it all
    for you. Very smart idea.</li>
<li>My Groups - Another staple. You can join groups and converse there.
    There are also systems in place to meet people, and rolls up a list
    of people online in your country.</li>
<li>My Comments - Collects and displays all of your comments on
    the site.</li>
<li>My Events -Allows you to create events that you are attending
    or making. Think of Facebooks event management.</li>
<li>My Books - The heart and soul of the site, and what I'm sure was the
    original conception to the site. This section lists all of the books
    on your bookshelves (you can customize your shelves) as well as your
    reviews for them as well as ratings therein. Really nice
    system, straightforward.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm glad someone actually went ahead and made a site like this. The user
base is still fairly small all things considered, but it has potential.
What I really like is that when I first log in I am presented with a
list of all of the reviews that have occurred in my absence. Considering
I just added <a href="http://bart.whahay.net" title="don't wait">Bart</a> and his
girlfriend (somehow she's already up to 78 books in her shelf... in 5
minutes) I'm already being assailed with a large list of books that I
can note down as to-read or actually add my own rating to.</p>
<p>In addition of the whole participant social scene within the site, there
is also an author listing, which is really interesting because not only
does it give you a biography of the author, their site, and what they've
written; it also allows you to become friends with them. I find this an
interesting change from the norm; it's like taking the fandom and
bringing them a step closer. It's a neat idea though I wonder how many
authors would actively participate in the site.</p>
<p>One thing I'm really in love with is the fact that when you rate a book
it's instantly added to your "read pile." What this allows you to do is
search for your books, add them, and then you can go back on your own
time and add your reviews. A great way to increase user use and
acceptance.</p>

<h3>The Bad</h3>
<p>I am perpetually cringing at the UI. I know I'm not a designer yet, and
I know that my opinion is one of many, but there are just certain things
that you don't do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using Georgia for EVERYTHING on the site is painful, and gets really
    hard to read. From what I've learned, Georgia is a "heading" font,
    not a "content" font. The reason for this (and I could be
    wrong here) is because Georgia isn't as readable at a smaller size
    then say, Arial or Verdana.</li>
<li>Having a lot of text on a page can get painful when it's not
    divided properly. Sometimes less is more, and if you simply have to
    display what you are displaying, then maybe applying a Grid to the
    content could help clean it up. This allows for a greater amount of
    text without being as busy-feeling.</li>
<li>Overuse of Google ads gets annoying, and detracts from what you're
    actually trying to sell (in this case, the functionality of
    the site)</li>
<li>Does it need a lot of the functions that it's offering? I know
    they're cool and all, but some of them could be dropped, or possibly
    expanded upon and moved into their own sub-site (My Writing comes
    to mind). The Events section is neat, but is it really required?
    <a href="http://www.facebook.com" title="Facebook">Facebook</a> does a pretty solid
    job, and sites like <a href="http://www.twitter.com" title="Twitter">Twitter</a>,
    <a href="http://friendfeed.com" title="Friendfeed">FriendFeed</a>, and
    <a href="http://pownce.com" title="Pownce.com">Pownce</a> do a great job of handling
    small blurbs about where you're going.</li>
<li>Thing's feel a bit buried. It takes too many clicks to do some
    things, and it gets painful. The general rule is that three clicks
    should bring you where you need, and they do meet that (for the
    most part). What's weird is that at the top right of your personal
    home page, there are "Add more books" and "Add more friends" links,
    but to add anything to the other sections (Quotes, Writing,
    Events, Comments) You need to go into those sections to
    add anything. Why not have those links under the first two Add
    links?</li>
<li>I've noticed a couple of programming bugs that make the coder in
    me cringe. Nothing major, but the site could use a little
    polishing, code-wise.</li>
<li>The search isn't all that robust. When it doesn't come back with any
    results, it doesn't offer any suggestions, which is becoming
    the norm. More than once I had to use the amazon search to find what
    I wanted, then when I added it, it magically found it within
    the system. A little annoying.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ending Thoughts</h3>
<p>Pretty neat, and I'll give it the old college try. I'm glad someone
actually decided to come out with a website dedicated to the review and
sharing of literature, I just hope the site doesn't go belly-up due to
lack of participation or some other crummy reason. A lot of cool
features, though I think that a couple bog the system down. The UI hurts
my brain, but I'm willing to get past that because the website has real
merit, and I want to contribute to a community that I can actually get
behind.</p>
