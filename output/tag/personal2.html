            <p>Being the smart man that I am, I thought "Hell, I'll just roll back a
version to when it worked! It's probably some little bug with Wordpress,
no big deal." I totally forgot my FTP information, so there was 40
minutes of my life I can't bet back.</p>
<p>In the end I rolled everything back and now the site worked again, but I
was still getting an error that I couldn't figure out. I tried
re-installing the latest version, and I was still getting an error which
totally confused me.</p>
<p>Now I'm getting angry. Something had changed between a couple days ago
and now. Could I remember? Of course not. If I could remember what ...</p>

was rampant to a scale that I have not experienced since, and that's
saying something. I've had projects where I've been up for over 40 hours
straight working because of scope creep, and I can assure that none of
them fell anywhere near what I was supposed to do for this company. On
top of that, every section had to have their own way of doing things,
and I had to try and figure out how to fit it all together in one neat,
little package.</p>
<p>Though the result is obvious already, I'll press on. I swear I have a
point to make with all of this.</p>

            <p>I actually meant to have the next installment of Designapalooza ready
for today, but sadly it's a big post, and I just did not have time to
finish it. Throw in the fact that my friends father passed away, and a
sour mood swing, and that spells "bad work ethic". Oh and I guess you
could also put a bit of blame on my reinstalling Diablo 2 (I don't know
why I did it) and playing the next installment of Phoenix Wright. Mostly
it's just been the sour mood, brought about by nothing I can figure.</p>

            <p>This is going to sound like an odd article, as I have yet to write
anything on this site remotely reflective or contemplative. I don't know
why, actually but that's just how it's turned out. In any case, I was
talking to Theresa on Sunday when the topic of my friend Norm moving to
Japan. She commented on how she was jealous of those who have "free
lives" or those who can just "up and do it." She also made the comment
that not all of them succeed, to which I responded with "those are the
ones that lack the strength of character to see it out."</p>

            <p>Hello one and all, I hope you've been keeping well! I've been pretty
mentally exhausted all week but I still managed to keep the content
rolling out. I've even managed to start a new book (already 160 pages
in) and actually do a bit of writing (another chapter 'done') and
generally getting some tasks out of the way. It's been a productive, but
exhausting week. So much trekking around, it's insane.</p>
<p>Highlights of the week include:</p>
<p><strong>I hate InfoPath:</strong><br />
I know the idea behind the program is sound, and I'm impressed with the
level of integration that Microsoft has managed to achieve with
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepointserver/FX100492001033.aspx" title="Microsoft SharePoint 2007">SharePoint
2007</a>
and

What I don't like is all ...</p>
