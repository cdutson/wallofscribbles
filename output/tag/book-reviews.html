well that I won't be the last. That aside, I have little choice but to
talk about The Last Lecture. I meant to talk about the original online

opportunity of a lifetime - the chance to be made smart intelligent - he
feels that his ship has come in. He takes the opportunity and is given a

parties. The first is the Greek Pantheon. The main pantheon live in a
crummy townhouse in London that is utterly run-down and otherwise
falling apart. They hate each other, though that's never been a secret.
The second part is the small and simple lives of Alice and Neil. They're
simple cuteness and obvious affection for each other (though hiding it

without smiling.</p>
