I'm a huge fan of stories. I really am. I read [my first
book](http://www.robertmunsch.com/books.cfm?bookid=48 "Robert Munsch - Good Families Don't")
before I was in school. I read my first novel by grade 2. I was reading
Tolkien by grade 4. I have a book shelf that I bought because my
original one was two books deep on every shelf. I've become a huge fan
of Podcasts like [The
Moth](http://www.themoth.org/ "The Moth - Stories Told Live Without Notes")
and [The Wayward
Irregular](http://www.waywardirregular.com/ "The Wayward Irregular") due
to the magic that comes from them. I will listen to any and everyone
that has a story to tell. All the more when they've got a flair for "the
telling."

I think it's save to say that ***I love stories***.

Hell I've even tried my own hand at writing a
[couple]({filename}../Writing/breakdown.md "Corey Dutson - Breakdown")
[of]({filename}../Writing/kam.md "Corey Dutson - Kam")
[my]({filename}../Writing/one-more-day.md "Corey Dutson - One More Day")
[own]({filename}../Writing/vindicate.md "Corey Dutson - Vindicate"). I admit that
they're not Pulitzer-level or anything, but I like to think that someone
out there will enjoy them. Regardless, I've recently decided that I'd
like to be told more stories. *Lots* more stories. What's more, I'd like
others to have the same opportunity. There are other sites out there
that do what I've decided to do, but I've opted to do something a little
different…

My focus is on the story.
-------------------------

I've made [Tell Me a
Story](http://storiesshouldbetold.com "Tell Me a Story - Because Stories Should be Told")
to do one thing: tell stories. The only requirements to tell a story are
a title, and the story itself. If you don't want to leave your name,
*you don't have to*. If you don't want people to contact you via email,
*you don't have to leave it*. Like I said, the focus is on the story.
There's no real limit on the kinds of stories that you can tell, short
of crazy graphic porn/slashfic (there are places for that), so I implore
you to tell me your stories.

The stories do go through a review process to help strain out spam,
stories that don't match the rather liberal criteria,
and blatant mis-use. I don't expect a lot of stories to be rejected, as
I'm pretty open to almost every kind of story telling.

So if you've got a story, [tell
it](http://storiesshouldbetold.com/tell).
