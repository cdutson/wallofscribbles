<p>Bethany, the world is a beautiful place. Life is short, and yet it's
long. Being here is such a gift.<br />
 Excerpt from The Gum Thief</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The synopsis is not something I can easily go through and so I shall
keep it short. Roger is a pathetic excuse for a man who is in his 40's
and working at Staples. Bethany is a girl who's a bit too old to be a
Goth with no real direction in life. She too works at Staples. They
connect through their writing each other notes. Nothing romantic in
them, but a connection is forged. And that is the simple yet stunning
basis of the book. From there it is a whirlwind ...</p>

<p>"One Cell in the Sea" is rather piano heavy (real piano, not synth...
though it features that too) and is a very calm, relaxed listen. It's
very melancholy and a little on the sad side... Not in that "I'm going
to kill myself the world hates me" sort of way, but more in the "you
just ended a 6 year relationship and moving on" sort of sad. Her voice
projects a stunning amount of clarity and emotion that ...</p>

            <p>Much of the movie revolves around the Vietnam War, and the protests that
went on during the time. All the characters are pulled into differing
sub-cultures and left to their own devices, and are let to play out
their lives with what they've gotten themselves into. It demonstrates
what people are capable of when they feel the need to work for
something. It displays people in their best and worst moments without
much in the ways of compromise, and shows that people aren't perfect nor
do situations always work out glowing. It does glaze over one or two
areas that probably could have had more explaining, but you cannot
realize this during the film and it probably isn ...</p>

watch this movie at about 3 in the morning after Theresa suffered a
horrible coughing fit (she developed a cough while at school). She
decided to put a movie on since she has this amazing habit to fall
asleep to any movie she sets her mind to. I sadly do not have the same
ability. In fact I could go so far as to say that if a movie is being
played, I'll be drawn to it like a moth to the flame, regardless of the
quality of the movie. All it takes is one hook and it's over.</p>

            <p>I finished the book with the same feeling that I've felt after reading
every other new adventure story so far (Winner Takes All, The Clockwise
Man, The Stone Rose, The Art of Destruction, and The Nightmare of Black
Island): Typical. The Clockwise is a possible exception, but not by
much. All these stories, though good, seem like they were rejects for
the show for simply not exhibiting enough strength. They're not bad by
any means and I enjoyed each of them in differing ways. What I am saying
is that I have yet to read a new adventures that can compare to the old
series.</p>

            <p>The first thing to note is that Mr. Brooks varies his writing style to
give each story a life of its own. No two narrators sounded alike, which
I have to admit was an impressive thing to behold. The second, and
easily the more important of the two, things to note is that the stories
for the most part managed to move me.</p>
<p>Considering the entire book is a work of fiction, Brooks managed rather
well to make it feel very real. What's more is that he managed to make
it feel very <em>human</em>. few authors can truly say the same.</p>
