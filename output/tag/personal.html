terrible to work at in a first world sort of way. I wasn't getting paid

management was... well that's where this story comes in. I won't name

writing something!</p>
<p>I hope you've found religion, because I'm going to start doing this more
often. What does this mean? This means that Corey is finally getting off
his lazy god-damned-ass and is going to start writing words in sequence
again.</p>
<p>Now if you put these sequenced words together, you will find that they
make sentences. These sentences, when grouped into logical sections
well, they become paragraphs. If I can actually manage to put enough of
these words onto a page, you could actually become entertained by what
may be considered an editorial, a review, or a terrifying essay about
clowns that live within your closet ...</p>

Japan via a friend of mine. Given that it was a trip to frikkin' Japan,
I couldn't possibly have said no. Had I known how long the flight was
actually going to feel, I might have reconsidered. Going there took
somewhere around 18 hours and coming back took almost 24. There's

passes when you're busy as hell during the end of days. I've been doing

really seem to give a damn. These teachers actually seem to want to help

grown ups - I said the same about

come to the decision that colleges must look like bigger high schools.
