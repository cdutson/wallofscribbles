        <p>So It's been a while since I wrote anything I felt was applicable to
whoring to 9rules, and so when I did go back to their site I had the
shock of finding out that
<a href="http://www.9rules.com/" title="9rules - The best content from the independant web.">9rules</a>
had changed. Drastically changed. At first I didn't even know what I was
looking at. Things had changed so drastically, I didn't know where to
start.</p>
<h3>What happened?</h3>
<p>First of all, they went through a drastic re-design which I am, for the
most part, a fan of. The problem with this is that they changed it all
so much I was utterly lost as to where to go. A better Idea could have
been to have a transitional layout to let people get used to things
before making a final switch. Not a requirement, and it's possible that
they did indeed do this. Like I said, it had been a while since the last
time I went.</p>
<p>The second part was that I couldn't figure out how to access my zone.
All that hard work of mine, and I couldn't access it. I still can't
figure out how the heck to get to it from the <a href="http://www.9rules.com/" title="9rules - The best content from the independant web.">9rules
site</a>.
The amount of user info that's left on 9rules is my username, email, and
password; none of which can be changed from the 9rules website.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the entire "community" portion of
<a href="http://www.9rules.com/" title="9rules - The best content from the independant web.">9rules</a>
has been completely removed. If you want to change your information,
whore your wares, or do anything the old 9rules did, you now have to go
to <a href="http://chawlk.com/" title="Chawlk.com">Chawlk.com</a>. That is, in essence,
where most of
<a href="http://www.9rules.com/" title="9rules - The best content from the independant web.">9rules</a>
went. It's still in a transitional stage, so the site isn't totally
finished, but it has everything the older
<a href="http://www.9rules.com/" title="9rules - The best content from the independant web.">9rules</a>
had, with an updated look.</p>
<p>All of the user-submitted content, voting, friending, point-usage, and
anything else that they used to offer has been moved off site, leaving
only approved posters rolling up to 9rules.</p>
<p>get_leader</p>
<h3>So where's the rule-breaking?</h3>
<p>I had no idea any of this had happened. Granted, I'm not a regular
member, so I had no idea this was coming. That shouldn't of happened
though. At the very least some sort of press release, newsletter, or
cursory email should have been sent out telling everyone that they were
going through a complete site reformation. I, as a member - and on some
level a customer/consumer - should have been notified that these changes
were occurring.</p>
<p>On a side-note, they also break a couple design rules by forcing me to
go to another website to change my information. This wouldn't be so bad
(<a href="http://openid.net/" title="OpenID">OpenID</a> floats to mind) except for the
fact that there is absolutely no mention of this other site, and I had
to go digging around to get the link. My old bookmark to my profile
actually redirects me to the new site, which in and of itself is a
jarring experience. Redirecting people without telling them is a no-no!</p>
<h3>So what do I think about it all?</h3>
<p>So what do I have to say about the new
<a href="http://www.9rules.com/" title="9rules - The best content from the independant web.">9rules</a>,
even after all my pseudo-bitching? I like it. I like that
<a href="http://www.9rules.com/" title="9rules - The best content from the independant web.">9rules</a>now
features premium content, complete with posted site submission dates and
a review process. Sure that screws me from posting my little posts on
their site (<a href="http://chawlk.com/" title="Chawlk.com">Chawlk</a> still allows it
though, so all is not lost) but I'm glad that I can't. At least now I
know that 9rules will feed me with information from reliable sources.
I've already found a couple of contributors that I want to add to my
ever-growing RSS store on Google Reader.</p>
<p><a href="http://chawlk.com/" title="Chawlk.com">Chawlk</a> on the other hand needs a
little work. I'm aware that It's in a transition stage, so anything I
say now may not apply in a month. First off, I love the "Chawlk is..."
at the top of the page, though the refresh button really isn't needed
for that. The User page is the same as it was on the old
<a href="http://www.9rules.com/" title="9rules - The best content from the independant web.">9rules</a>,
which makes me a little sad. Sure it's neat that they have a Twitter,
Last.fm, website RSS, and Flickr feed hookup, but it makes for a rather
convoluted looking page.</p>
<p>Have a look at
<a href="http://chawlk.com/my/loveless/" title="Chawlk.com - Loveless">mine</a>: It's
just too busy. Everything is so big, that once you start pumping in
content it gets bulky and too much for me to bother looking through. A
possible option for them could be to separate the last.fm and website
rss combination. put the last.fm on the left beneath the Twitter box,
and possibly move the Flickr over to the side as well. I don't know what
the Flickr section looks like because I haven't really used Flickr, not
have I tied <a href="http://chawlk.com/" title="Chawlk.com">Chawlk</a> to my Flickr
account. The end result is an empty section that never finishes loading.</p>
<p>I'd also suggest making things a little smaller. You don't need each RSS
entry to be an inch tall. That's just a waste of space, and actually
helps detract from clarity. It'd be nice if they allowed you the ability
to hook into other social networks such as FriendFeed and Pownce.</p>
<h3>Ending thoughts</h3>
<p>The new
<a href="http://www.9rules.com/" title="9rules - The best content from the independant web.">9rules</a>
is a great improvement, as far as I'm concerned. Stripped out all of the
crap and just left the lean, delicious high-quality content. Accessing
your user info is a bitch, and a friendly link in the user window would
be a great asset.</p>
<p>The newly-formed <a href="http://chawlk.com/" title="Chawlk.com">Chawlk</a> needs some
work. As it is everything that 9rules discarded, I can't help but feel
that that's exactly what it is: discarded. It feels lower on the quality
scale, and I hope it doesn't continue that way, otherwise the whole
thing will probably go belly-up. I'm reserving saying to much about it
as it's still being worked on at this point. It needs work, I'll leave
it at that</p>
