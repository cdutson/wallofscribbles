-   [Ad-Aware](http://www.lavasoftusa.com/products/ad_aware_free.php "Ad-Aware Free") -
    I don't need to give this program any real kudos or description as
    it's a common name on the internet. If you happen to be a
    [Luddite](http://www.reference.com/search?r=13&q=Luddite "Luddite: defined")
    or have somehow avoided hearing of this program it's simple:
    Ad-Aware is a spy-ware/ad-ware/mal-ware removal tool. Does a fine
    job for what it is. I still have Ad-Aware SE, though that's only
    because I'm not impressed with the new version and how they removed
    some functions from it. I'm pretty sure SE will be unsupported soon.
-   [AVG Anti-virus](http://free.grisoft.com/ "AVG Free Advisor") -
    Again, I shouldn't need to talk about this program as
    it's everywhere. This is a free version of Grisoft's
    Anti-virus program. I like it, though it's active scan is pretty
    processor heavy. I know there are options to turn down the footprint
    on it, but I'd rather my scan not take 12 hours to complete. They
    also have an anti-spam tool (much like Ad-aware) but that program
    bugs the hell out of me (large, bulky/overly 2.0 and not all
    that intuitive) which I'm staying away from. The Anti-virus is
    great though. No faults that I can see.
-   [CCleaner](http://www.ccleaner.com/ "Crap Cleaner") - This program
    basically is the Windows Cleanup tool done right. It scans your
    computer for useless files, temp files, and otherwise dead space
    that can be freed up. It also does registry cleaning and can clean
    out things such as cookies, history, and certain windows
    internal lists. I run it every once in a while to clean things up. A
    great download.
-   [Daemon
    Tools](http://www.daemon-tools.cc/dtcc/announcements.php "Daemon Tools") -
    For those of us that like to mount DVD images, this program is
    pretty much a standard. It's easy to use, effective, and is
    utterly free. For a mounting software, this is a very happy bonus.
    It has great features that allow you to run your mounting system up
    to different modes, should you wish it.
-   [EditPlus](http://www.editplus.com/ "EditPlus") - A classic
    language editor. By now it's a bit dated and not the most advanced
    program on the internet, this program is basically Notepad
    on steroids. It comes with syntax highlighting and quick text (if
    you download the correct syntax files). I've used it since I was in
    college and can give credit to Bart for showing it to me. I'm still
    using this over [Komodo
    Edit](http://www.activestate.com/Products/komodo_edit/ "Komodo Edit")
    simply because I'm to lazy to really start trying [Komodo
    Edit](http://www.activestate.com/Products/komodo_edit/ "Komodo Edit").
    If I make the switch, then Komodo can go on next years official
    list.<!--adsense-->
-   [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/ "Firefox")- I don't
    even know why I put this on the list because in all honesty this
    should be pretty much standard. I know there are variations like
    Firefox Wonder and a billion add-ons for it and so I'm just going to
    leave this one alone. A million websites can describe it better
    then I. The short of it: better than Internet Explorer. Please don't
    bother to flame me on this.
-   [Firebug](http://www.getfirebug.com/ "Firebug") and [IE Developer
    Toolbar](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=e59c3964-672d-4511-bb3e-2d5e1db91038&displaylang=en "Internet Explorer Developer Toolbar") -
    The same tool for different browsers. It basically allows the user
    to crawl and manipulate the page in real time, which can be a huge
    life saver when you need to brand
    [certain](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepointserver/FX100492001033.aspx "SharePoint 2007")
    products, or are developing a new layout from scratch. I have both
    installed to make my life easier when changing things on the site or
    if I'm curious as to how someone managed something with
    their layout. Both are free and worth investing if you do any
    web development.
-   [SmartFTP Client](http://www.smartftp.com/ "SmartFTP Client") - If
    there is anyone out there that still uses Windows as their FTP
    program (I was guilty of this for far, far too long), fear not! This
    FTP program is simple to use, handles everything you could possibly
    expect, easy to navigate, and free. Sure it will assault you with
    "Buy Me" messages on boot, but other then that it's perfect. I don't
    know how I managed without it.
-   [Stickies for
    Windows](http://www.stickiesforwindows.com/ "Stickies for Windows") -
    Why have sticky notes cluttering your screen when you can have
    virtual sticky notes scattered all over your desktop. This works
    much like the Macs sticky note function and not much else. It allows
    you to pick sticky note colour, transparency, and font. You can also
    pin the stickies so they'll show up on top of every other window.
    Simple and useful, It's probably the most used program on
    my computer.
-   [uTorrent](http://www.utorrent.com/ "uTorrent") - There are a
    variety of torrent programs and this was my personal favorite. It's
    simple to use and displays all the information you could need.It's
    got a clean, easy to use layout and even has an integrated
    (and ad-stapled) search functionality that allows you to fire off
    searches without actually opening your browser (it does it for you).
-   [Visual Color
    Picker](http://www.linxexplorer.com/colorpicker.html "Visual Color Picker") -
    The be all and end all of colour pickers. It comes with an
    eye-dropper tool for live picking, a magnifier, and the ability to
    switch between every colour mode on the planet and play with all the
    levels that exist therein. Returns the values in any format you
    could dream of.

And there you have it ladies and gentlemen.There are certain programs
that didn't quite make the list include
[SequoiaView](http://w3.win.tue.nl/nl/onderzoek/onderzoek_informatica/visualization/sequoiaview// "SequoiaView"),
[ArtRage 2](http://www.ambientdesign.com/artrage.html "ArtRage 2"),
[WinRAR](http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm "WinRar") (I honestly didn't
bother. I don't think it does any better than winZip, I've just used it
for so long), [Komodo
Edit](http://www.activestate.com/Products/komodo_edit/ "Komodo Edit"),
and [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/ "Last.fm"). They didn't make it for
varying reasons, but I'm still giving them the honourable mention here.
I really hope someone gets something useful out of this.
