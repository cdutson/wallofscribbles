You know, every time I have one of these impromptu hiatuses - hiatusi?
hiatusae? - I always try and recall just what caused me to stop posting.
It's not like I was posting every other day and got burnt out, no no, I
was posting once a week. But of course the cycle dies off and you end up
with what, a five month break in posts?

That's not kosher.

The irony is that if I had just managed to keep up with my weekly
posting, I would probably have a more complete list of things that I
have actually done. It's a self-defeating cycle of suck, and I seem to
really enjoy the ride. Never mind that I ride it in a busted up canoe,
or that the ride takes me through a course that would make most
white-water rafting professionals crap themselves just a little. I do it
for the *thrill*.

Alright that may have sounded a tad insane, but I was on a roll and went
with it.

So as stated it's been a good 5 months since my last post, and I've got
no good explanation for the break in content. I did just get back into
school and I did start applying myself more for freelance stuff, but
that's hardly an excuse. Regardless, I'm back on the horse for now, and
I'm feeling if not inspired, than at least motivated. To kick things
off, I'll give a quick rundown of everything that's been going on with
me recently.

I swear I'm not that self-involved. No, really I'm not. I am not a
self-centered arrogant prat! Good god, you kiss your mother with that
mouth? That's *sick* man. *Sick*.<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

Personal Development
--------------------

### Python/Django

I am very slowly getting my head around
[Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/ "The Django Project"). Thankfully
I have my good friend and partner in crime, [Bartek
Ciszkowski](http://bart.whahay.net/ "Bartek Ciszkowski") to point out
the many things I am doing wrong. I'll actually have my first
self-initiated site going up soon that has been built as both an excuse
to get Python/Django experience, and because the site concept is near to
my heart. I'll make sure to post a grand opening post talking about it's
many virtues when it's up.

Hopefully that'll be sometime this week.

### Shopify

I've recently been given the opportunity to work on a freelance project
involving the creation of
a [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com/ "Shopify.com") theme. Now I'd only
ever heard of Shopify through the placement ads on the Boagworld
Podcasts (if you are a web person, their podcast is a must-listen). I've
started playing with the system they have in play - very closely related
to the templating system used in Django - and I have to say I'm in love.

The templating is easy, it's fast, it works, and they even provide an
offline environment in which to develop locally called Vision. Honestly
these guys have done a bang-up job of making it as easy as humanly
possible to create sexy store themes.

I will be doing some more work
with [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com/ "Shopify.com") to be sure.

### Reading

I've been on fire recently with reading. I admit I'm not reading books 1
a day as some people I could point towards to, but I've been really
getting into Graphic Design literature. I'm not talking about online
writings - though I do follow those as well -  I'm talking about honest
to goodness books. I will be writing reviews for the ones I've got
through already, but to keep up with what I'm reading you can have a
look at my
[Goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1198481-corey-dutson?shelf=read "Goodreads.com - Corey Dutson")
profile. You may notice a slight theme regarding social change through
design in many of the design books I have read (and continue to read),
which is something I feel strongly about.

I'll probably end up writing a rather long-winded post/rant on just that
topic alone.

Work stuff
----------

### GraphicRiver

I've dipped my foot into the *could-be-lucrative-if-you-stick-to-it
market* of stock imagery. If you are interested in any of my texture
packs, than I ask that you click this [shameless advertising
link](http://graphicriver.net/user/Corey%20Dutson/portfolio?ref=Corey%20Dutson "GraphicRiver.net - Corey Dutson")
and support me. I'll actually be starting on creating some Shopify
themes soon (they have a section for that), as that's an area I've
recently been introduced to and am in love with. I'm not expecting this
to really pay any bills, but I like the idea of passive income.

Who knows, maybe one day it'll pay for a trip. Maybe a domestic flight.

### Freelance

I've recently been working on a couple of freelance items that should be
making their way to the internet soon. I'll hold off on actually listing
them in this post, but I'm happy to say that I'm getting some more web
work. If anyone is interested in throwing more my way, you can of course
contact me by email or using my [contact
page](http://www.wallofscribbles.com/talk/ "Wallofscribbles.com - Contact Me").

Either way, my portfolio page is going to start growing; something I've
been trying to do for a while.

Everything else
---------------

### School

I'm almost done, a fact that I am proud to say. I'm chomping at the bit
to get out of school and really get into the field. This being my second
time through school, my attitude is very different than that of the 18
year old me. With being in my last semester, I can happily say that I've
maintained an average that would cause younger me's brain to ooze out of
his head. This is of course only because I've busted my ass (another
thing young me wouldn't think possible) to get those grades.

As it works out, those who say "you only get out of it what you put in"
are wiser than I thought.

Peer-tutoring and Office work continue to present me with new
opportunities to scratch my chin in a ponderous but mind-blown manner.
From students managing to remove their dashboard, to learning how to
apply vinyl signage to interesting projects for the Ontario Government,
my jobs never cease to educate me.

### 360

With Theresa off in England and not in England, I find myself with a lot
more time on my hands. Though I have filled much of that time trying to
grow my portfolio to that of "reasonable" - as if there is such a thing
- as well as reading, I've actually found myself playing my [XBox
360]({filename}360-degrees-of-failure.md "Wallofscribbles.com - 360 Degrees of Failure")
a lot more. Most of my time recently has been split between
[Borderlands](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/b/borderlands/ "XBox.com - Borderlands")
and [Ticket to
Ride](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/t/tickettoridexboxlivearcade/ "XBox.com - Ticket to Ride").

Both are good, solid games, though my appreciation for Borderlands
shocked even me. I wasn't too keen on the game when it first came out,
and it took repeated playings to really get. Now I'm on my second
playthrough in solo mode, and I'm actually rather enjoying it. Maybe
it's just the challenge of everything wanting to murder you that spurns
me on. Ticket to Ride is just good wholesome fun.

### Life-changing stuff

So this one's a little different. When I graduate, I'll be flying over
to England where, as previously stated, where my girlfriend is currently
teaching children to not be destructive whirlwinds. It's a bit of a
chance for me, but I'm really looking forward to it all. The hardest
part is trying to land a job or some interviews with places in the
Greater London area. Those guys are *good*.

Regardless I'm contacting some, so we'll see how well that goes.

Alright, so there you go; a very brief overview of what's going on. I'll
have a bunch of events as blog fodder in the coming weeks, so stay
tuned.
