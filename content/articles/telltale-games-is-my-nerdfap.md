Please observe this screenshot from Telltale Games [newest
release](http://www.telltalegames.com/samandmax/chariotsofthedogs "Telltale Games: Sam & Max Season Two Episode Four").
Those of you who know me and my nerdy interests will instantly see two
things about the screen shot that I love dearly. So instead of making a
fulfilling post, I've been playing this game for far too long.

I don't even feel bad.

I really do suggest that everyone purchase and play the hell out of the
new Sam & Max series. [Both
seasons](http://www.telltalegames.com/samandmax "Telltale Games: Sam & Max")
are fabiola.

That's right, I said fabiola.
