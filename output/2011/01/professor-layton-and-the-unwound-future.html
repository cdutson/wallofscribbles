        <p>Oh look, another <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B003O6E7DI?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=walofscr-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=B003O6E7DI" title="Amazon.co.uk - Professor Layton and the Unwound Future">Professor
Layton</a>.
I don't think I need to outline once again how every Professor Layton
game holds me firmly in its thrall. I've lost sleep with
<a href="/2008/professor-layton-and-the-curious-village-level-5-2008" title="Wallofscribbles.com - Professor Layton and the Curious Village">each</a>

Basically as long as Level 5 keep coming out with these games, they will
keep taking the money I throw at them.</p>
<p>That said, the new Professor Layton came with a veritable feast of new
mini-games, new puzzles, and one of the best story-lines in a game I've
played in the last while. As a result, the newest addition to the series

Future</a>)
ends up being the best of the series (thus far).<!--more--></p>
<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<p><img alt="Professor Layton and the Unwound
Future" src="http://wallofscribbles.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/professor-layton-unwound-future-300x269.png" title="professor-layton-unwound-future" /></p>
<p>The Unwound Future takes place after the events from the Diabolical Box.
Layton and Luke have been invited, somewhat at random, to a
scientific demonstration of an apparent time-machine. Things go south
(as all preludes in this series do), and days later you get a letter
from Luke that has a posting date from 10 years in the future. Now since
Layton has conquered ghosts, missing peoples, phantom trains, and
imaginary clockwork people, solving a temporal mystery just seems the
next logical step.</p>
<p>Luke and Layton follow the instructions, and end up at a mysterious
clock shop (surprise, surprise). When brought into the back of the shop,
a giant clock awaits them. This is, apparently, a time machine, and
before they can think it through, the shop owner throws the switch and
Luke and Layton are thrown into the future. Here they notice the changes
(and similarities) between them. Eventually they run into Future Luke,
and things just get weirder.</p>
<p>As the story unfolds, you find out that the scientist from the
demonstration and Layton have some shared past. Namely, they went to the
same school, and happened to be in love with the same girl: Claire. The
scientist (Dimitri, in case you're wondering) at first seems to be out
to get Layton due to Layton's winning the affections of Claire. Things,
though, are not what they seem. As the story progresses, things get well
messed up, and it really does take right up to the 11th hour for
everything to come to light.</p>
<p>It ends with, in my opinion, one of the saddest endings I have ever
witnessed on the DS. Possibly one of the saddest endings on any Nintendo
title that I've played. Things are tied up well, if not nicely, and
you're not really left with any questions other than '<strong>WHY DID THEY
JUST DO THAT TO ME?</strong>" I was honestly more upset than I thought
possible, given the game I was playing. I didn't sob or anything, but it
did move me.</p>
<h2>Mechanics</h2>
<p>The core mechanics of the game have been left pretty much unchanged. New
faces, new places, but the environmental stuff hasn't moved on much. It
doesn't really need to, either. They got it right the first time, so
there's not much of a need to change it. Tap everywhere to find puzzles
and/or hint coins. Solve said puzzles with or without the help of said
hint coins. Move on.</p>
<p>The mini-games have changed again. You now get a toy car game, a
parrot-guiding game, and the sticker-book game. The toy car game is
similar to the hamster game from the last Professor Layon, with a few
obvious changes (water, comes to mind). The sticker-book game is fun
because you have to put the correct stickers in the correct spots on the
page. When this is done, you get to read the whole story. It's a
bit juvenile, but entertaining.</p>
<p>Then there is the parrot game. <em>I hate the parrot game</em>. I hate it more
than slider puzzles, and I <em>really</em> hate slider puzzles. The idea is to
draw ropes from peg to peg in order to help the parrot (who can only
seem to hop short distances) get to end flag before the timer runs down.
I'm just going to say right now: I cheated. I don't even feel bad about
it. Know why? because I spent hours and hours trying to legitimately
figure the damned parrot puzzles out, and to no avail. Well screw that
noise, I have better things to do (<em>shutup I do so</em>) than to run the
same parrot simulation over and over and over and over and over and
motherfucking <em>over</em>.</p>
<p>get_leader</p>
<h2>The Highs</h2>
<p>The laytest installment (see what I did there?) comes with a heaping
dose of wonderfully animated cut-scenes, which are pretty much par for
the course by this point. The music is wonderful (the alteration of the
main/professors theme is sublime) and as goes well with both the puzzles
and the story points. Some new items have been added to the score
selection, though the puzzle theme remains just as ponderous as it
always was.</p>
<p>A special shout-out has to be made here for the grace in which the
Professor's history is handled. While I enjoyed the previous two stories
for being entertaining, the Unwound Future is the first in the series
that actually made me care about any of the characters. Even Luke, who
in many cases I find to be grating, was given a lot more ... Luke-ness.
That's a good thing, surprisingly. They really went the extra mile to
make the characters mean something more to you than simple puzzle gods,
and it shows.</p>
<h2>The Lows</h2>
<p>Slider puzzles make a shining return in the latest installment, which of
course means that I stared at the DS' screens for a while, scowling in
hate until my fail-safe method of random sliding paid off. On top of
that, the writers really went out of their way to include more utterly
ambiguous riddles. I'm talking about the kind of riddles that
legitimately have more than one answer (which makes them shit riddles to
begin with) but will only accept whatever cryptic answer they keep
locked up in their brain-can. Also, there were a small number of puzzles
that looked eerily familiar to past Professor Layton puzzles. I worry
that they may be running out of puzzles for the series. Hopefully not.</p>
<p>I also have to say that one of the lows was the feeling of utter
depression I got upon finishing the game. I could spoil the ending for
you (though I will not) and ruin your day, but suffice it to say that it
really struck a chord for me. The only thing that makes a depressing
ending worse though, is an <em>unnecessarily</em> depressing ending. They
didn't need to do what they did,  but I guess they felt that the best
ending to a light-hearted puzzle game would be to break everyones heart.
Repeatedly.</p>
<p>Woe upon the parents who buy this game for their 11 year old daughter,
only to have her run into their room, sobbing uncontrollably.</p>
<h2>Overall</h2>
<p>A great addition to the Professor Layton series, and what will probably
go down as my favorite. That is of course until this comes out, and I am
forced to purchase a 3DS just to play it.</p>
<p>Regardless, it's a great title, if not a bit depressing at the end, and
I highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the series. I would
suggest picking up the
