[Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along
Blog](http://www.drhorrible.com/ "Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog")
started out free on the website, though only for a very limited time.
After that it was whisked away to iTunes where those of us too slow on
the uptake were reprimanded by having to pay 2 dollars an episode
(totaling an impressive six dollars). Trust me when I say that it was
easily the best six dollars I will have spent this year, bar none.

[Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along
Blog](http://www.drhorrible.com/ "Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog") is
about "Billy" a bad buy - Dr. Horrible - trying to make it into the big
leagues. He's also in love with a girl from the laundromat - Penny - and
has his own nemesis - Captain Hammer. The three episode arc shows how
Dr. Horrible tries to get into the league, hands the girl of his dreams
over to his nemesis, and just how far he'll have to go to be recognized
as a true super-villian.

Did I mention he video blogs at the start of the episodes? *Fantastic*.

[Neil Patrick
Harris](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000439/ "IMDB: Neil Patrick Harris")
was probably the best casting job ever performed by man-kind, as he
plays Dr. Horrible so well that you can see that though he's evil, he's
actually a pretty nice guy. [Nathan
Fillion](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0277213/ "IMDB: Nathan Fillion") -
ever present/utterly brilliant in the Joss Whedon universe - is given
the job of playing Captain Hammer, the arrogant super hero that beats
the hell out of Dr. Horrible at almost every meeting. They both have
feelings for Penny ([Felicia Day](http://feliciaday.com/ "Felicia Day"))
who is one of the most next-door-girl cute I've ever seen cast, and
plays penny so well that I'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who could
fit the role better.

I'm trying to figure out if she dyes her hair from brown to red, or from
red to darker red. I think I see roots, but I just can't tell.

I fell in love with the series literally from the opening of the first
episode. Great intro music to some quick credits, followed by one of the
best evil-doer laughs ever recorded to film. You could bottle that and
sell it on shelves it was so damned good. The rest of the story followed
the same amount of effort and brilliance, dimming only for the "Bad
Hoof" songs, which didn't really do it for me. I'm going to have to dub
"Freeze Ray" as the best song out of the entire show. It's just so
damned cute in it's own twisted way.

Find a way to see this people; [Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along
Blog](http://www.drhorrible.com/ "Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog") is 43
minutes of pure gold. I paid 6 dollars for it, and I honestly feel like
I got a great deal out of it.

10/10
