Summary: The Children’s Safety Village of Brant wanted a new way to book the courses they had available.

Their current system was paper-based, and patchy at best. They wanted a
way for teachers to book a course without having to fax in a dated form,
and perform callbacks and reminders and a slew of other manual jobs.

The booking system had to be simple to use for both the teachers booking
classes, as well as the administration managing the system. Teachers of
the courses, local Police, and Fire Officials all needed a way to log
into the system and review upcoming courses, eliminating the need to
call the administration.

I designed an online booking system that gives teachers an easy and
streamlined way to book courses. The four step guide walks teachers
through the process, explaining things along the way. It was very
important that certain messages regarding costs (and ways to save on
them) as well as outlining class-size limits. These had to be taken into
consideration with the design, so that the messages were clear, but
didn't draw away from the form process itself.

The aministration panel was addressed in a similar way; streamlining
simple tasks and adding important noti cations to explain what their
actions will do. As our administration users weren't all going to be
overly tech-savvy, we had to make sure to do some hand-holding through
some of the more critical processes. This meant that deleting bookings
and event dates, along with edits and the like, had confirmation pages
built into the flow. These ended up being very important.

Local officials could have accounts created for them to allow them
viewing access. We introduced a multi-tier user system that allowed the
administration to have control of not only who logged into the back-end
of the system, but also what those users could do once they got there.
Basic users could view the up-coming schedule, and edit their own
details, but couldn't remove bookings or event
dates. Administration users had full access to the system.

I worked with a very talented friend,
[Bart](http://bartek.im/ "Bartek Ciszkowski"), to bring the whole
project to life. We used a very iterative process to make sure that we
could concentrate on solving one problem at a time. While I focused on
building up the front-end markup and most of the JavaScript, Bart
concentrated on wiring up the code-behind to make sure the system worked
as quickly and as smoothly as possible.

As of the writing of this portfolio piece, the system is still being
used and still running smoothly. They've more than made up their ROI on
the project.
