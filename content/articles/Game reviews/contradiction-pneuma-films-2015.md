When's the last time you played a game with real live-action acting? [Wing Commander 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpxItq_r7to), perhaps? Or maybe you need to go further back, such as a couple star games on Sega CD or the 3DO? I know I was a sucker for [Sherlock Holmes: Consulting detective](http://store.steampowered.com/sub/69999/) (though to be honest I never actually solved a single case).

They were good times then. Simpler times. Terribly acted, best-left-in-the-past times. I honestly didn't know FMV games - that is, **f**ull **m**otion **v**ideo - were still being made, let alone a smattering being released this year. One such game, [Contradiction](http://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/373390/), got a decent amount of attention and was funded the same way every game seems to be made these days: KickStarter. It intrigued me so much so that I was persuaded to purchase it after a night of not insubstantial drinking.

I should make more of my purchasing decisions while half a bottle of [Spicebox](http://spiceboxwhisky.com/) into my evening, because [Contradiction](http://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/373390/) is fabulous.

_**Update:** Just a quick note that since writing this, the game has come out with some updates that deal with some of my gripes with the UI. I've made updates to this article where appropriate. Thanks!_

##Synopsis

You are Detective Jenks.

You've been sent to Edenton to investigate the suicide of Kate Vine; apparently someone isn't convinced that she would simply up and off herself. You are given until the following day (more accurately until around midnight), to draw your conclusions and be on your way.

You are quickly introduced to most of the main cast, as well as a couple of extras used strictly as exposition. The cast is small, so you end up seeing a lot of - and getting sick of - them over the course of the evening.

You have Simon and Emma who live together in a house: Simon's on the same course as Kate was, Emma claims to have no real interest in it. Then you've got Paul and Ryan: the father/son duo that run the Atlas course that seems to be at the centre of everything. You've got Rebecca: the woman who runs the towns only pub and is also married to Ryan. Lastly you have James: the local conspiracy theorist who is sure there's more going on than meets the eye, as well as having problems making eye contact with anyone ever.

As you dig into Kate's death, you start to find that things are not what they seem. Everyone has secrets and no one is in the mood to help a police officer dig through theirs or their neighbours metaphorical trash. As the night goes on, the story twists on itself repeatedly, presenting you with new information. It's down to you to sift through everything and figure out what's important and what's junk.

You wander the town, annoying it's inhabitants to no end until at last you figure out what, if anything, happened that fateful Friday night. It's a classic whodunit story with all the trappings: some questionable acting, convoluted story points, loads of useless information used to distract you, and a really satisfying ending.

##Gameplay

[![You are Detective Jenks]({filename}../../images/contradiction-pnuma-films-2015/detective-jenks.jpg){: class=aligncenter }]({filename}../../images/contradiction-pnuma-films-2015/detective-jenks.jpg)

For the most part the game is a very straight-forward point-and-click adventure game. You have navigation arrows to move you from screen to screen _(you can now use the mouse in the most recent update)_, you have a map to quick-jump from area to area, you have an inventory where you can review your notes and look at all the junk you acquire. 

Let's be honest for a second: Jenks basically roots through people stuff and property (without a warrant) and just takes what he wants. The man is a loose cannon, playing by his own rules. If he didn't get results, by God he'd be off the force.

You navigate the town, finding evidence, interviewing people, and as it says in the title, find contradictions. You present the contradictions by selecting 2 statements given by the person you are interviewing, and more story may revealed.

As you progress through your interviews, certain events will trigger time to move forward. As near as I can tell, there doesn't seem to be a way to end up in a fail-state scenario, so that's not really something you need worry about.

That's pretty much it. Mechanically, it's a pretty simple game. It's extremely linear, as it's more about telling the story than by introducing branched options or fail states. To that end, there are no fail states that I could find, and the only way you could "branch" is by not asking certain people about stuff because they're bloody useless about it.

##Graphics

Graphics are sort of hard to discuss for this game. I mean, it's pretty much entirely full-motion video. It's real actors saying real lines in real environments. You cannot get better graphics than that. I will give a special shout-out to the games use of a shallow fixed depth of field for most of its shots; it makes for a great look and helps make the interactions feel at least a bit more personal.

The acting, for the most part, is pretty good. Most of the actors do their job, and do it well. At times things get a bit soap opera, but let me be clear: that's not an insult. It works for this game, where other games would really suffer for it. 

James' inability to make eye contact most of the time was somewhat unnerving, and I cannot tell if that was direction or just how the actor opted to play the character. Ryan is flamboyant, but works well within his role. Kyle's just the angriest kid ever, and I think that could have been toned back. Paul and Rebecca's actors were told, I assume, to try and emote as little as possible.

[![Act more, Jenks. ACT HARDER.]({filename}../../images/contradiction-pnuma-films-2015/act-harder.jpg){: class=aligncenter }]({filename}../../images/contradiction-pnuma-films-2015/act-harder.jpg)

And then there is the star of the show, Rupert Booth. He is truly something else.

Rupert is the actor who plays Detective Frederick Jenks. I honestly can't tell if he was doing his goofy pseudo-doctor-who thing on purpose, or if he's just terrible at acting. You honestly can't tell by the end. At first blush you assume he's just really bad at his job, but the character kinds of grows on you after a while. It's corny, but in a good way. By the end, I was actually looking forward to another instalment with Jenks in the lead.

It's all shtik, but it kind of works.

The camera work was decent (as I mentioned above with the shallow depth-of-field shots), and I think their use of real environments (shot in a small village in Cheshire) really adds something special to the game. It's not just flat panels to look at; leaves rustle, water ripples. It's a subtle detail, but makes a world of difference.

So what about any of the actual graphics? The graphics used for the menu system or anything you really interact with? _Awful._ 

[![This UI is junk]({filename}../../images/contradiction-pnuma-films-2015/old-interface.jpg){: class=aligncenter }]({filename}../../images/contradiction-pnuma-films-2015/old-interface.jpg)

It's all basically vector art, which is not a bad thing in itself. The problem is that when you stick to using the basic shapes and solid colours, it tends to look like _you didn't even try._ Contradiction looks like the UI was bolted on minutes before release. It almost looks like they shipped with placeholder art in some places. It all looks like they learned how to use the Square, gradient fill, and circle tools in illustrator and thought "Yeah, sure. Ship it." It's amateur-feeling to say the last.

Look at the picture above. I mean really look at it. It would not take a lot of effort to clean that UI up. What is doubly insulting is that it looks a _lot_ better on the [iPad version](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id953844528). I don't know why they thought to redo the UI for the steam version, but I am not a fan.

_**Update:** The UI's gone through a bit of an overhaul since the update. It's still not great, but it's a damned sight better than it was. There's still a lot of room for improvement, but way to go, game creator._

_I'm leaving the old screenshot up so people know what it was like  when I played through it. I'm glad they're making an effort though._

## Sounds and music

Not much to say, really. The sound engineering is solid. The soundtrack (made by the mastermind behind Contradiction, Tim Follin) is spot on. It flows with the story, and works rather well to set the correct mood and tension. The accent sounds (clicks, stings, etc) are subtle and aren't over-used. Top marks for the application of sound within Contradiction.

##Issues

[![That polished interface]({filename}../../images/contradiction-pnuma-films-2015/interface.jpg){: class=aligncenter }]({filename}../../images/contradiction-pnuma-films-2015/interface.jpg)

###The interface is a nightmare

Beyond the interface looking amateur at best, the general interface and key setup is a nightmare. The default keys seem randomly assigned (you press 8 to make the game full screen, as an example) and that's assuming the keys work when you're told you can use them.

I want to note that I never changed my key bindings (I rarely do), and yet some of the key instructions didn't work. On a couple screens, you will be told to press say, **A** to do something, but it doesn't actually work. You _actually_ have to press **enter** to do make things happen. Stuff like this pops up all over the game, and just kind of reeks of sloppy workmanship.

_**Update:** They've added the option to navigate by mouse, as well as a clickable menu for accessing various parts of the game (inventory, etc). This is a lot more usable for casual players, and negates a bit of what I've been saying. Why it was removed in the first place is still a mystery to me._

Playing with the interface for 5 minutes in this game, you can _feel_ that it was a quick port from the iPad to Steam. Adding injury to insult is that the iPad version is only 5 dollars, but the Steam version will cost you double that (at least).

###Feels sloppy

Leading from the interface, there's a lot of general sloppiness in the game. Beyond the insane key bindings and mis-labelled actions, You've got little bugs sprinkled throughout:

- **The game never actually saved my preferences.** I had to re-enable captions every time I launched the game, which I have on because I have a baby and she cries like a banshee at the drop of a hat. I need to know what people are saying as my ear drums are being ruptured. Every time I got back into the game, I had to make sure to press **C** to enable them again. I usually remembered to do this half way through a conversation, because you cannot activate them _during_ an FMV moment.
- **The game asked me to re-bind my keys every time I launched it.** Every. Time. It asked me regardless of whether I bound them explicitly or not. It also seemed to lose my game progress (as indicated by the main menu page) every time I started up as well. My progress wasn't actually lost, mind. Once I resumed the game, it remembered where we were and everything was fine.
- **There were some typos in the captions.** There was also caption text that didn't line up to the spoken script.
- **No matter where you saved, you are thrown back to the centre of town.** Whenever you relaunch the game, you start at the pub. Doesn't matter where you were or what you were in the middle of, you start off at the pub. Saving map locations cannot possible me that hard.

It's the little things like these that really hurts Contradiction. It's a fun game, I swear it is, but these little things can really add up to ruin a players' experience.

###Aimless wandering

This is a problem with most murder mystery games that requires you to hunt for clues and/or people, and hunting them down is tedious. [The Phoenix Wright series]({filename}phoenix-wright-ace-attorney.md "Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Capcom (2005)") , [Time Hollow]({filename}time-hollow-konami-2008.md "Time Hollow - Konami (2008)"), Ghost Trick; they all suffer from this as well. When you're not actively dragging contradictions out of people, you have to result to re-visiting every location (as well as the paths between them) because sometimes there's an event that has to fire to progress the story. There's never an indication of these things, and it really ate at my enjoyment of the game.

If you're not wandering around looking for events to fire off, you're normally showing a single piece of evidence to _everyone_, which forces you to run all over town just to see if someone knows anything about _Simon's bloody bike._ Hell, there's one point in the game where we ended up running back and forth between a couple people, and it was soul-crushing.

When you're not running all over hells half acre for events or show-and-tell, some times you are left mashing statements together trying to find the contradiction with a person. Most of the time you can figure it out, but there were 2 or 3 times my wife and I got stuck because the phrases that contradicted didn't really seem to line up in any obvious way. This is a problem that many adventure games suffer; mash item A and B together. Did it work? If not try item A with item C. Rinse and repeat. Until your eyes bleed out of your scull.

[![Stalking people in their ho-- I mean, investigating!]({filename}../../images/contradiction-pnuma-films-2015/outside-the-lodge.jpg){: class=aligncenter }]({filename}../../images/contradiction-pnuma-films-2015/outside-the-lodge.jpg)

###Contradicting feels limited

I understand why they limited the contradictions to be just within one character: It simplifies the interaction chart for the game which makes it easier to script, and easier for the end player; scripting multi-person contradictions takes infinitely longer to do; making cross-person contradictions will also cost more to produce what with testing, writing, recording, etc. 

When you limit the choices to X character statements, instead of X^y where y is the number of people whom you have statements from, you drastically reduce your complexity in every facet. It's a trade off.

That said, there are _many_ instances within Contradiction where two people had very different things to say on behaviour, an eye-witness account, or even their opinion of another party. I would have loved to have been able to use those statements to bust some people down. It would have been a hell of a lot faster than having to slowly drag out statement after statement by going back and forth between three people, and would have made me feel more like I was actually sleuthing.

##Overall

In spite of it's navigational drawbacks, as well as it's almost complete disregard for a control scheme, my wife and I really enjoyed Contradiction. We had legitimate aha moments and honestly couldn't predict the ending. We were both intrigued by the changes in the story, and enjoyed the soap opera that we got to play a part in. 

I really wish the game was longer and boasted a more in-depth story. We finished Contradiction in seven hours, and that includes a decent amount of time aimlessly wandering and mashing phrases together to see what stuck. A smarter person or persons can probably get through this game in 4-6 hours. That's not really enough for the price they're asking in my opinion. The iPad version at 5 dollars seems like a much more reasonable price-to-length ratio.

So in the end I really enjoyed Contradiction and I know for damned sure that I'll buy the next one if and when it comes out. More care for the technical details would have made for a much better end product. I know it sounds silly to get hung up on the interface, but when you spend as much time in it as you do in Contradiction, i really starts to grate on you.

In the end, Contradiction is a great story that forces you to use a sub-par interface. It's worth playing, but don't be shocked when you get irritated with how you interact with it all.

6.5/10

_**UPDATED SCORE: Since they've fixed the UI some, I'm bumping this up to 7/10.**_
