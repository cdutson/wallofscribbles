<p>"Coming to" and "sobering up" are two distinctly different states of
being. Each has its own independent schedule, and each comes with its
own shocking revelations.<br />
 Excerpt from I Am Not Myself These Days</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The story as I stated revolves around Josh/Aqua and his time in New York
City. I refuse to say much about the book because revealing anything
truly feels like a spoiler. Josh meets a man by the name of Jack during
one of his club nights as Aqua, and the two hit it off in the most
insane ways. Did I mention that Jack was a call boy who's clients mostly
want him to beat them up and call them scum? No? Well there you go. I'll
let that pique your curiosity.</p>
<p>The writing style is very much in the first person, though it does
switch between tenses rather quickly, which forces you to pay attention.
The transitions can be jarring at time, but for the most part the story
flows well. It's not often that a book can spur real emotion in me; sure
I can feel for the characters in the book, but few can actually make me
feel happy or sad based simply on the words in a paragraph. This novel
manages to do just that which sets the mark way higher than normal. The
book is a laugh pretty much the entire way through, and even provides
many an insight as to the live of a professional drag queen.</p>
<p>Some of the ending seemed a little drawn out, and I found myself
skimming through a bit of it. On top of that the book does get a little
repetitive, though I think that was partially the intention. Repetition
and spiraling seemed to be a major theme throughout the book... so maybe
this memoir is also a cautionary tale? Maybe it's more of a guidebook
for those in the scene. I have no idea really and I refuse to read more
into the book than what is probably there. I will say that you have to
get the P.S version of the book if only for the added part about Jack.</p>
<p>I can safely say that <a href="http://www.myspace.com/joshkilmerpurcell" title="Josh Kilmer-Purcell">Josh
Kilmer-Purcell</a>
has lived an interesting life, if only in small, explosive bursts. I am
eternally thankful that he decided to write this memoir to share with
the world. It's actually one of the few books that I can say that I read
straight through without getting bored. Hell I sat in a luke-warm bath
just to finish the last 30 pages of the damned book, just because I was
so eager to finish it! Suffice it to say it's high on my list of good
books.</p>
<p>To think I found it in a book overflow store while waiting for a venues
doors to open. I mean it's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Am-Not-Myself-These-Days/dp/0060817321" title="Amazon.com">right
there</a>
on Amazon.</p>
<p>Read this book people, seriously.</p>
