            <p>So the recently passed weekend offered to me an adventure:
troubleshooting the Internet connection at Theresa's place. Now some of
you may be wondering how troubleshooting someones Internet connection
could be an adventure, and I completely understand your confusion and/or
skepticism. Believe me that I wasn't expecting an adventure for
something that was, at the time, very straight-forward.</p>
<p>You see on Sunday afternoon, the Internet connection at Theresa's house
was dreadfully slow, and would randomly disconnect for a couple seconds
at a time. Just enough time to cancel any sort of operation you were
hoping to do while browsing the Interwebs. I, being the only tech-savvy
person about, was given the … opportunity to correct the situation ...</p>

have to actually listen to the whole album through two more times to

            <p>It's been a long, long time since I've played any <em>real</em> arcade-style
games. Last time I picked up a controller to play any sort of
side-scrolling, button-bashing, streets-of-fury style game I was a much

<p>See the problems with my playing these sorts of games are:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm no good at them.</li>
<li>I lack the toned fore-arm muscle of the veteran gamer.</li>
<li>I lacked a console.</li>

<p>Well I <a href="/2009/01/06/360-degrees-of-failure/" title="Corey Dutson: 360 Degrees of Failure">now have a

            <p>Wow, it's been a while since I've done a game review. Could be because
It's been a while since I've played a game through to completion. Sadly
I am finding it hard to make time to dedicate to playing games when
things like school and work are in the way. Pesky thing, responsibility.</p>
<p>Having said that, with my school giving me far too much time off over
the Christmas break, I managed to get my hands on a shiny new XBox 360.
Granted that was a <a href="/2009/01/06/360-degrees-of-failure/" title="Corey Dutson: 360 Degrees of Failure">bit of a
fiasco</a>,
in the end I landed me a couple of games. One of those games (obviously,

aside, I have actually started producing WordPress plugins for myself.
I've always wanted to make them, and so a while back I set aside a day
(well two, once I got the hang of it) and learned. Granted I've still
got a ways to go, but at least I've finally got my foot in the door with
it all. The trick is to make sure to create things that are actually
useful so that people will actually use them.</p>
<p>So as a result of my tooling around with WordPress, I've created two
plugins for people to use.</p>

The album was supposed to come out a while ago, but when your house
