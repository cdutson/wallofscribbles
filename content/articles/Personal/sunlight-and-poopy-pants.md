So hey, it turns out babies? They poop. Like a lot. Like multiple times a day. Babies poop like they've eaten nothing but curry paste and ex lax. Babies poop like they're in some kind of hotdog-eating competition, but in this case the hotdogs are poop, and the eating is pooping. Baby's poop like they don't give a fuck, because they're babies and they don't even have a concept of giving a fuck.

I've gotta work on my metaphors. And my similes.

So hey, this post is about baby poop. Skip it or strap in, cause I'm numb to it all now and I'm not sure where the rest of the world is with this stuff. It's not all negative though, I swear.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

## This is the part where he talks about poop

Everyone who's had kids will tell you that baby poop is an adventure all its own. Heck, my daughter's only 4 months old, and I know that shit's gonna get weirder as she gets older. 

Yeah, puns and swearing and poop all in one. That's where we are now. That's what's happening.

In any case, my daughter's not even on solid foods yet, so god help me when that happens. I'm sure there'll be another post about this another couple months. In it I'll be chuckling at the poor, naive chap writing this post. "YOU HAVE NO IDEA, YOU IGNORANT MORON!" He will yell into the past, secure in the knowledge that past him will never hear it.

Where was I? Oh right, poop. Specifically baby poop. Baby poop is weird, man. And I'm not talking about those first fresh couple hospital/home care/whatever poops. I'm not talking about Meconium, or the weird pilling poops or anything like that.

My daughter is currently in the "cheap street curry yellow" poop phase. Sometimes it smells, sometimes it doesn't. Honestly after the first week or two, you become utterly desensitized to it all. I've gotten it on my hands, my clothes, once actually on my face that I was never able to figure out. You grab yourself a wet-wipe and you soldier on.

## Why the hell is he still talking about poop?
"Why the hell is he talking about this?", you've got to be wondering at this point. If you're not, than you're more into this than I am, but whatever turns your metaphorical crank. I'm talking about this because to some, it's just something you wipe off your kids nethers, and toss away the refuse. If that's you, than cool, cool, cool. The next part of this post won't matter to you, but the last bit probably will!

So my wife and I made the decision to use cloth diapers for our daughter. I could tout that it's better for the environment and such (it is), but the honest truth is that it's a helluva lot cheaper to do the reusable cloth diapers than it is to buy the disposables.

[insert some math here about it all later]

## Cloth Diapers: they're cool again. I guess.

We did our research, and eventually decided on [Kengacare's Rumparooz](http://www.kangacare.com/Rumparooz-One-Size-Cloth-Diaper.html). They get great reviews, they're super flexible in sizing, have a removable soaker (important), biodegrade in a landfill, and they look super snazzy to boot. We've also got a couple of the [bumGenius Cloth diapers](http://www.toysrus.ca/product/index.jsp?productId=28918546) from Babies r us, that also work, but we're not as stoked about.

As if one could really get stoked about cloth diapers.

The Kengacare diapers work really well. We've not had one leak yet, and by god has our daughter put them through a trial by fire. The bumGenius ones work fine, but since they're all-in-one, it makes cleaning them more awkward than I'd like. And if you're wondering, I do most of the cleaning of said diapers.

Here's the thing: you can't just hose 'em off and toss them in a hamper. For one: they'd smell awful cause, you know, poop (and let's not forget urine, cause that fucking reeks as well); two: Unless you are constantly doing laundry, those bad boys are just gonna sit there (that's bad); and three: that butt-curry your baby's pushin' stains like turmeric.

We've found that despite rinsing them and washing poop-laden articles of clothing (because poop goes beyond just the diaper) we were unable to actually remove the stains. I'm sure we could bleach them out of the white stuff, but what about the rest?

Enter stage left: Sunlight.

## Sunlight, saviour of the cloth

Now I'm not talking about actual sunlight, that is: rays of light that come from our sky fire orb. I'm talking about [Sunlight soap bars](http://www.amazon.ca/Sunlight-Lemon-Laundry-Detergent-Gram/dp/B003Y7OB1A). My mother-in-law introduced us to the brand, and like most savvy customers, I was skeptical. She showed me the results, and I opted to test them myself at home.

Now I am not a brand whore (he says typing away on his macbook, while his ipad and iphone charge near by, and the mac mini attached to the nearby tv lays in wait). I'm not one to simply take a recommendation and die on that hill. I am, however, open to suggestions on how the hell to remove the permanent yellow that had etched its' way into my daughters clothes and diapers.

Holy shit though. I've never gone from skeptical to convert for a product in so short a time. The sunlight bars absolutely demolished the stains. Even ones that had been through the wash a couple times. We thought we would have to toss the clothing, and instead we got to use it one more week until our daughter grew way too fast.

Seriously. These sunlight bars are _fantastic._ I cannot stress this enough. They remove all signs of poop from clothing as well as the diapers. The only thing they have _any_ trouble with are the soakers themselves. Sunlight seems to be able to remove 90% of any stain in a soaker, but just can't get that last little bit. I assume it has something to do with the materials made to construct the soaker.

As a bonus though, the Sunlight bars do remove the stains from the bumGenius diapers pretty much perfectly. Anything that didn't come out from the spot Sunlighting gets removed when we throw them in the wash after.

I should say that yes, even though I spot-treat the diapers to remove the perpetual poop stains, I still toss them in the washing machine for a good, proper wash. Seems to work out pretty well.
