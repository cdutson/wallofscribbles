            <p>I try and avoid political issues for the most part. That is to say, I
try and avoid writing about them. I try to do so because there are
better venues to have these discussions,which thanks to the Internet,
generally degrade into tinfoil hat-wearing crap-slingers raging at each
other. It's hard to have an intelligent conversation about it 90% of the
time, so it's best to avoid it on small blogs.</p>
<p>That said, I'm going to break my rule a bit here and make a point to say
that Canada, as a 'great example' of a democracy has some of the worst
voting numbers I have ever seen. I'll admit that I'm not that ...</p>

<p>So yeah I'll admit that it's been a while since I've updated (roughly
two months for those sharpening their pitchforks) and I could say that I
was super busy what with my end of year projects totally consumed my
life, or that I was a tad busy moving countries, or that I haven't had
real internet access since being here, or that I was just a lazy prat
who found loads of other excuses to avoid writing something.</p>

passes when you're busy as hell during the end of days. I've been doing

            <p>That's sort of a crime, don't you think? They have two major parties,
and the candidates vie for supremacy until it is down to two
presidential candidates and their running mates. Then those two groups
campaign for over a year, and then on election night, every possible
station is glued to the election and they bust out some sweet technology
to make all this shit that much cooler. To top it all off, at the end of
the night, both the winner and the loser give solid, stand-along
speeches that actually make you nod your head, tear-up, or just feel
proud.</p>

            <p>So as some of you may have noticed, I didn't post at all last week.
Quite simply, this is because I spent pretty much every waking hour at
work. Hell I gave up sleeping hours to be there to. Wednesday I was at
work for 18 hours, got 4 hours of sleep, then went to work the next day
for a fun-filled 31-hour shift. A word to the wise, if you are ever
installing <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/isaserver/prodinfo/default.mspx" title="Microsoft ISA Server 2006">ISA

sure you put it onto a separate server then the one holding your
website. Trust me on this. Unless you want to be awake at 3 am, 6 hours ...</p>

sour mood swing, and that spells "bad work ethic". Oh and I guess you

<p>I've been somewhat busy over the past little while what with work and
all. I've finally started my job at The Revolution Night Club in
Waterloo. I thought that my working from 10 to 3 in the morning would
beat me up way more then it actually has. As long as I get a nap in
before going to work, I'm fine. Besides, It allows me to wake up at 12
in the afternoon, which is some sort of accomplishment for me.</p>
