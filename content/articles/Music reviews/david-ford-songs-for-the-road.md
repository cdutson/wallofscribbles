This man feels the music, the likes of which I haven't seen in a good
long while. His music was heart-felt and well composed. Even when he did
his song "State of the Union" which was more of a spoken poem and
performance art, he obviously felt his music.

As a result, [Songs for the
Road](http://www.amazon.ca/Songs-Road-David-Ford/dp/B0014DCTH4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1203909841&sr=8-1 "Amazon.com: Songs for the Road")
is a solid album, though I wouldn't class it as Indie, despite what
iTunes tells me. Easy listening is closer to the truth, but I can assure
you that the tracks will swing between calm and relaxing to bouncy to
depressing with little regard for your personal feelings at the time of
listening. As a lot of the music is done by him alone life, the alum is
similarly toned down. Many of the tracks have nothing more than a guitar
and a piano, though few feature violins and if I'm not mistaken in at
least one instance a cello. His voice is enjoyable to listen to and his
accent actually penetrates which is rare for English singers. I don't
know why but many English artists tend to lose their accent when they
sing.

The album takes a couple listens to really get into, though I picked my
favorites fairly quickly. I can appreciate the other tracks - Decimate
sounds like it should be at the start or end of a sitcom - more for
their lyrics, even when I feel that the music doesn't suit my personal
tastes. All of the tracks have obvious thought put into their message
which really elevates them amongst many of the mainstream "heart" songs
that are out on the top 40.

The whole album is a little moody, though that falls right in character
with David Ford himself. The result is that you will either like where
he's coming from, or think he's trash. I love him.

7/10
