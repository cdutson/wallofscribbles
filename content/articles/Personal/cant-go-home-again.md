So recently I got the opportunity to attend a conference in the UK. [FullFrontal](http://fullfrontal.org/) is a fantastic conference for front-end developers, but honestly I'd recommend it to anyone who's at least kind of interested in technology. It's a fantastic day of talks that range from inspiring to insightful to straight-up entertaining.

The conference itself was only one day, but it was cheapest for me to be in the UK for a week. How I persuaded my wife to allow this is something I will never understand. I know sure as all get out that it won't happen a second time.

I was excited by the prospect of visiting the UK since I lived there for years. I expected it to be a whirlwind tour of friends and places, food and drink, and good feelings all around. And it was! I got to see friends, eat foods, and also suffer one of the worst hangovers I've had in years. What I didn't have were the good feelings.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

## What is home?
There's an old saying: "You can't go home again." Which as a child I always thought was an odd one. I mean, unless your home has literally disappeared off of the face of the world, you can always revisit it.

I'm older now, and I've learned a thing or two. Home isn't just a place; home is a feeling. Home is a complex combination of feelings and emotions that's unique for each person. Despite my deepening understanding of this, I have never really experienced what the saying was trying to get at.

My family moved away from what I consider my childhood home when I started college. My parents put our house on the market in the morning, and by the time I got back from school that afternoon, it had been sold. 

That was a jarring experience, let me tell you. 

Despite the fact that we moved to a new town, I transitioned pretty well. The loss of my childhood home only made me sad for a couple days. 

Our new house was fine, and my parents have done much to it over the years to make it their home. It was not, however, mine. It wasn't intended to be; this was the home my parents wanted. I just happened to be rooming with them for a while. I'm not bitter about this, I'm just trying to explain that I was never overly attached to either my childhood home or the one my parents have moved to. They were both nice, and I've many lovely memories in them (as well as some not-so-lovely). They are a part of who I am, but I wasn't deeply connected with them in any way (at least to my knowledge).

That disconnected feeling changed when I moved to the UK.

## The big move

I moved to the UK days after I graduated college my second time. My then girlfriend (now wife) had moved there to get teaching experience. The state of the Ontario teaching environment is something left for another time, but basically it's a fucking wasteland of unions and corruption and bad policy. Kinda rough on new teachers, to say the least.

Anywho, She moved there and I followed. When I got there, I stayed with her for a day in the sort-of hostel she was in. Well I did until a woman in the room across reported me being there and I was ejected from the building. I was effectively homeless in London. Theresa would sneak my back in at night, but I had to leave at 6 in the morning so that no one saw me leaving.

Cheery woman, she was.

I took it upon myself to find us a new place to stay, and it turns out I work pretty well under pressure. In one day I had found us a new place - an adventure all its own - and together we scraped the money together for first and last. It was ridiculous how poor we were: Theresa had $$16 dollars in her account, and I had maxed out my withdraw limits on both my bank and credit cards.

Our place was a bachelor pad, and we shared that place for over a year. We affectionately refer to it as the "relationship tester" because you had nowhere to go. You were very close to your other person all the time in that place. It was hard sometimes.

Things got easier after that: Theresa found a steady stream of teaching jobs, I quickly landed a job that made good, consistent money. It took a while, but we got our shit together. 

I'm telling you this not because I want applause for our pulling ourselves up by the bootstraps. I'm telling you this because this was when both of use went from being young kids playing at being adults, to actually having to put up or shut up. This first year was what turned us both into contributing members of society. We became real people.

## Living in Ol' Blighty

The next couple years went by quickly. More quickly than I wish they had now.  It is human nature to just get on with things, I think. We moved a couple more times; my wife and I got married; we made and lost friends; we travelled as much as we could. In our time there, we easily visited 20 or so countries together.

The reason we decided to leave was due to our wanting to start a family, and more specifically my desire not to raise a family in London. Now I don't wish to disparage anyone who opts to raise a family in London: go for it! You do you! We didn't want to raise a child that would be a London kid. They grow up too fast and have a bit too much attitude. They seem to level out around 25. We (more I than Theresa, but still) didn't want that.

I also knew that we would need some family support. Everyone we knew in the UK at the time were childless. We'd have no one to relate to, and no one that could really help us out. I knew it was going to be extremely stressful on us, and I just didn't want us to go through that.

It was a tough choice, and one that I still think over from time to time. I know my wife does the same. We really started our life there. We made friendships, we got into a grove, we were happy people, we were _home_ there. Leaving England still remains one of the hardest things we've done. It sucked. There was no good answer, and like adults we had to talk it out, make a decision and move forward.

So we left.

We moved back to Canada and we're currently living in Toronto. Theresa went back to school for something other than teaching (again, hive of scum and villiany), and she also went and got herself pregnant. 

Things are hard here: we make way less money since Theresa isn't working, and Toronto is expensive to live in. We don't get to travel like we used to, we don't get to do a lot of the fun things we used to do. Hell, with a child we don't get to do much of anything, fun or otherwise.

Because of this, both Theresa and I think about our time in England with a wistful sigh and talk about how much happier and easier things were, totally ignoring the fact that we have a child that we're not factoring into our rose-coloured visions of times gone by.

## Oh my god why are you telling me this please get to the point already

So back to the intro. I got to go to London for a week because of the generosity of my [company](http://gadventures.com) and an excuse to go to a fantastic conference. I had expectations about what I would do, what I would feel, who I would see, etc. I got to do some of the things I wanted to do, I got to see most of the people I wanted to see. I was expecting to feel nostalgic, and I was. 

What I wasn't expecting was how sad I was going to feel at the same time.

Things aren't the same, and it took me going back to realize it. Friends I knew are gone, restaurants I loved have closed, things were just _different._ I was staying with some friends who live right by my old home. I got to walk the same streets, but they didn't feel right anymore.

My home wasn't mine anymore, and it hurt. It still hurts to think about. Maybe I'm just overly sentimental, but that's how I feel.

I got the chance to meet up with a bunch of friends (and I was given a hell of a hangover for the opportunity) but that didn't make me feel better. Don't get me wrong, I was and am very happy I got to see a lot of friendly faces, but all it did was remind me that I'm not from here anymore. It reminded me of all the people we left behind. It also reminded me of all the people I couldn't invite, because they had moved on, had families, had other things they had to deal with.

I'm was visitor in my own home.

You'd think that this would mean that I should pack my family up and move back to London; that we'd be happier there. Maybe, maybe not. Our child will still end up being a London kid; London grinds you down the longer you're in it; housing is expensive, and; we'd be going over with even less money than the first time we live there. We would be diving in the deep-end to chase what we used to have, and something that's not there anymore.

I'm not saying we will or won't go back, but shit gets complicated the older you get. Doubly so when you have kids. 

## I'm in a glass case of emotion!

You can't go home again. Even if you can stand on the same stones, walk the same lanes, or see the same people: you can't revisit your past. Things change, it's the way of the universe. Hell, it's probably one of the very few universal truths.

I was happy to go and see my friends living across the pond. I was happy to see where I used to work and play. I was happy to drink some decent goddamned cider for the first time in nearly 3 years. I was happy to eat 50p samosas and some decent chocolate.

I was happy to visit, but that's all it was: a visit.

I had a moment while I was there. I had just finished eating a burger at a Byron in Hoxton Square. It's one I used to visit all the time for lunch with coworkers/friends. I ate by myself, because apparently other people work during the day or something. 

As I was walking out and towards a pub where I was going to meet friends, a song came through my headphones: Butch Walker's [ATL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp1BdWzEOGM). It's a song about a man who leaves his home and comes back hoping it can make him whole again. It's a depressing love letter to the home he used to have, and I couldn't handle it. The whole experience knocked the wind out of me, but at the same time summed up exactly how I was feeling. It was brutal and lovely in equal measure.

I'm glad no one I knew was around to see me then, because I was a mess. I got to have that moment all to myself.

So... do I regret leaving? After a lot of thought I can honestly say: no. I was tired of the grind and all the angry faces in every cramped crowd. My wife isn't constantly working her perpetual teacher hours. I have a beautiful daughter now that I probably wouldn't have had. Our extended families get to be a part of our lives again. We have friends here. It's not our home yet, but it will be.

My home is with my new family: my wife and our child. You may not be able to go home again, but you can bring it with you.
