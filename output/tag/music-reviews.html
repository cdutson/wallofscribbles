Hell, I'm sure a lot of people really love this album. I want to like
it, but I keep getting hung up on things. I know two things will happen
with this review. First, anyone who is a massive fan of The Midway State
is going to nail me to the wall and then stone me to death. Second, I'll
have to actually listen to the whole album through two more times to
actually find songs that I like.</p>

            <p>I have been waiting for a long, long time for a new album to come
rolling out from <a href="http://www.butchwalker.com/" title="Butch Walker">this man</a>.
The album was supposed to come out a while ago, but when your house
burns down due to some forest fires that are ruining the local
forestry... well I can understand a delay.</p>
<p>Thankfully after my faithful wait, I have been rewarded with his new
release: <a href="http://gomerch.com/interface/body.php?module=store&amp;catid=15&amp;id=34" title="Butch Walker: Sycamore Meadows">Sycamore
Meadows</a>.
After giving this album a couple of listens, it has quickly become one
of my favorites for all time. It's both amazingly happy and startlingly
deep, many times simultaneously. <!--more--></p>

<p><a href="http://www.datarockmusic.com/" title="Datarock">Datarock</a> is easily one of my
new bouncy favorites. The only way I can describe them is disco acid
pop. There's probably a better way of explaining them, but that'll work
for lack of the creation of new words.</p>
<p>As an aside, I want to apologize for the title of this post. I'm using
the normal format, but their first album is actually called "Datarock
Datarock" so it makes for some crummy article titling.</p>

<p>How can I describe this album? I guess it's Indie, but not really. It
really has a bluegrass/pop/alternative blend that really defies clear
classification. Brian O'Neal (way to hard to find his real name, Jesus),
who goes by <a href="http://www.roarkmusic.com/" title="Roark">Roark</a>, does a
fantastic job of delivering heart-felt song after heart-felt song. Each
track sounds like he means every word, which is a rare treat in this day
and age. Though he is technically a solo artist, Brian does have someone
helping him in the studio ...</p>

doesn't really introduce much new, other than a couple slower piano
tracks and a slightly softer feel. MCS know what their sound is and they
don't really seem to want to step away from it too much at the moment.
I'm not saying that that's a bad thing, though I think that at this

<p>The whole album is very mellow, and I could almost class it as an
'easy-listening' but it doesn't quite fit. The songs all feature a
slightly slower beat, and there is emphases on strong musical usage. The
singing is put almost as a second thought, much like the way that The
Strokes perform their music. The music comes before the singing, but
they don't conflict. There is heavy usage of the piano, which stands out
as the major player within most of the tracks ...</p>
