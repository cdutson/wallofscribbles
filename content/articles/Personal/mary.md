I actually meant to have the next installment of Designapalooza ready
for today, but sadly it's a big post, and I just did not have time to
finish it. Throw in the fact that my friends father passed away, and a
sour mood swing, and that spells "bad work ethic". Oh and I guess you
could also put a bit of blame on my reinstalling Diablo 2 (I don't know
why I did it) and playing the next installment of Phoenix Wright. Mostly
it's just been the sour mood, brought about by nothing I can figure.

It's been a while since I've done a personal post, and for the first
time ever, I can't even think of what to say. Usually I am bursting with
witty remarks and enough sass for two, but alas, I just don't have it in
me today.

I guess I'm in a subdued mood for having gone to
[Dan's](http://www.danielkukwa.com/ "Daniel Kukwa") father's viewing.
I'm not an expert with dealing with departed relatives, and so I'm
hardly an expert on what to during these situations. I can say a couple
things on it though, and if you're still reading this, I'll assume you
will indulge me in my speaking of them.

*There is nothing, and I mean nothing, more heart-breaking then
listening to a woman truly sob over the loss of her spouse.*

Nothing comes close. I half-pride myself on my ability to disconnect
myself emotionally from situations when the need arises. Believe me when
I say it comes in handy, regardless of how much of a monster you may
thing it makes me. Seeing Dans's mother today taught me something
though, and as a result I was nearly in tears myself.

As useful as my skill is, there is a time and a place for it. It felt
wrong to turn myself off from seeing this womans grief. Utterly wrong. I
think this proves that I'm still human, because though I cannot know how
deep her pain must go... I was nearly moved to tears just watching her.
There was love in one of its purest forms, reddening her eyes and
running her nose. It was wonderful and heart-wrenching to witness. I
can't even do her justice with my writing ability. Some things just
aren't that simple. She loved him, simple as that.

*Even the strongest of people need help.*

I've noted over my friends struggle through his fathers illness and
eventual passing. He was the stone amongst the family. He was the one
that drove everyone around, made arrangements. He was there at the drop
of a hat while everyone would breakdown, have a scream-fest, or
otherwise be ... immature. I hope to the powers that be that they know
just how hard that was for him. Somehow I doubt it, and he wouldn't
expect them to notice because he doesn't feel it's required. I recognize
it though, and I pray that when I am thrust into that position, I can
handle it half as well as he has. It hurt me deeply to see how much
strain this put on him but I also know that he wouldn't have asked
anyone else to take the burden, and that makes me proud to be his
friend.

I don't have a point for the next one that I can articulate properly,
and so I will simply quote:

*"After this I'm going to go home with my parents... I guess I can't
even say that now... ... I'll go home with my mother and get her
sorted."*

I cannot explain how sad Dan was, right at the realization of saying
parents. You could see the pain in his eyes, and how much it hurt him to
have to internally adjust the whole thought process. It's the most
emotion I have ever seen from him, which may paint him in a bad light,
but I don't mean to. He is a man that controls his emotions, and even
though he didn't break down crying right there... you could tell that a
part of him wanted to. It's hard as a friend to have to sit there
knowing that there isn't anything more that you can do.

And believe me, you always want to do more in that situation.

*Do not get retired, near-blind, stuttering priests to do the Rosary
sermon.*

I don't really need to explain this too hard. The priest - bless him
(heheh) - was a nice enough fellow. He was also 90% blind, and
stuttered. He also hopped around like a budgie in a cage. It helped
lighten the mood somewhat, well at least for me it did. I'm sure there's
some sin for that.

Wow, this post ended up being a real downer. Ah well, I don't care. I
can be self-indulgent sometimes.

I honestly wish I could have gotten to know you better, but I will say
that you've raised some damned fine kids, and had a good family. You
will be eternally missed.
