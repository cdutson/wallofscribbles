[Their newest
album](http://www.epitaph.com/artists/album/523/Even_If_It_Kills_Me "Epitaph Records: Motion City Soundtrack - Even If It Kills Me")
doesn't really introduce much new, other than a couple slower piano
tracks and a slightly softer feel. MCS know what their sound is and they
don't really seem to want to step away from it too much at the moment.
I'm not saying that that's a bad thing, though I think that at this
point you could start to find their music exhausting. My only complaint
with MCS is that they sound pretty much the exact same every song. Sure
you change up the words and the chords, but it's all the same. This is
also a great aspect though because you know what to expect and so a
returning fan knows what they're getting themselves into.

I also have to note that "Last Night" sounds eerily similar to [The
Starting Line](http://www.startinglinerock.com/ "The Starting Line")s
"Photography".



My bitching aside, "Even If It Kills Me" is a solid album. I did notice
that "Even If It Kills Me" seems to be a little slower, a little softer,
and a little more toned down then its brethren, which I wasn't fully
expecting. I really liked the step into different territory by going
with a couple piano-driven tracks, which bring about a totally different
feel to what would be a purely typical album by them. The whole album
seems a tad more reflective than the others, which is always a good
thing in my mind.

I'm still not sure what they were trying to accomplish with this album.
Did they mean to make it sound more reflective? Or was that just a
side-effect of something else? Where did the piano-driven songs come
from? Why the detachment from the norm? I have a feeling that the whole
group just wanted to aim for something different, but didn't want to
step too far outside the comfort-zone that is their sound. I can't blame
them, but it does make what could have been an amazing (or disastrous)
album, and settles it into the 'pretty good' category.

7/10
