            <p>I am not a fan of <a href="http://www.rockstargames.com/" title="Rockstar Games">Rockstar
Games</a>, generally. Not
to say that they don't do good work, but their usual fare just isn't
something that I can enjoy for more than about 10 minutes. Grand Theft
Auto 3 and onwards always felt tedious (regardless of how much you can
personally achieve in it), and Red Dead Redemption just seemed like the
same thing, but with cowboys.</p>
<p>The whole 'open world, do what you want, oh by the way there's some
actual story here if you wanna play it' model never really did much for
me. It's neat and all, I get the appeal, but I never really got into it.</p>

            <p>It's actually been a while since I've been to the theaters. The last
time I was there, I saw TRON. We all know how I <a href="/2010/tron-legacy-it-made-me-has-a-sad" title="Wallofscribbles.com - TRON Legacy. It made me has a sad">felt about
that</a>.
Generally I'll watch movies at home rather than pay the anal-rending
prices that the UK movie chains charge their unsuspecting victims.</p>
<p>However, there are a bunch of legitimately interesting movies coming out
right now. So much so that I am willing to go to the movie theaters to
watch them (though I'll admit that this decision is assisted heavily by
the 2 for 1 deal I can get every wednesday).</p>
<p>One such movie that has just come out here in the UK is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Swan_(film)" title="Wikipedia - Black Swan (film)">Black

<a href="http://www.pixar.com/index.html" title="Pixar.com">Pixar</a>. There is a reason

enjoyed. Last year I watched

though I didn't have time to write about it. Had I, I would have given
it a solid 10/10 because there was nothing

            <p>It's been a long, long time since I've played any <em>real</em> arcade-style
games. Last time I picked up a controller to play any sort of
side-scrolling, button-bashing, streets-of-fury style game I was a much
younger person. With SNES controller in hand, my friend and I playing
the likes of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_in_time" title="Wikipedia: Turtles In Time">TNMT: Turtles in

<p>See the problems with my playing these sorts of games are:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm no good at them.</li>
<li>I lack the toned fore-arm muscle of the veteran gamer.</li>
<li>I lacked a console.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well I <a href="/2009/01/06/360-degrees-of-failure/" title="Corey Dutson: 360 Degrees of Failure">now have a

            <p>I have been waiting for a long, long time for a new album to come
rolling out from <a href="http://www.butchwalker.com/" title="Butch Walker">this man</a>.
The album was supposed to come out a while ago, but when your house
burns down due to some forest fires that are ruining the local
forestry... well I can understand a delay.</p>
<p>Thankfully after my faithful wait, I have been rewarded with his new
release: <a href="http://gomerch.com/interface/body.php?module=store&amp;catid=15&amp;id=34" title="Butch Walker: Sycamore Meadows">Sycamore

After giving this album a couple of listens, it has quickly become one
of my favorites for all time. It's both amazingly happy and startlingly
deep, many times simultaneously. <!--more--></p>

<p>The story as I stated revolves around Josh/Aqua and his time in New York
City. I refuse to say much about the book because revealing anything
truly feels like a spoiler. Josh meets a man by the name of Jack during
one of his club nights as Aqua, and the two hit it off in the most
insane ways. Did I mention that Jack was a call boy who's clients mostly
want him to beat them up and call them scum? No? Well there ...</p>

            <p>Over the Christmas holidays, Theresa and I went to our local
<a href="http://www.princesscinemas.com/" title="Princess Cincemas">independent movie
theater</a>, and
watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0467406/" title="Juno">Juno</a>. I have to
say that it's easily one of the best films I watched in 2007. It was
sweet, funny, and potent in all the right spots.</p>
<p>The movie Juno is about one Juno MacGuff (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0680983/" title="Ellen Page">Ellen
Page</a>) and Paulie
Bleeker (the ever master of awkward pauses, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0148418/" title="Michael Cera">Michael

joint child-making. The movie takes place during the nine months of
Juno's wonderful adventure through pregnancy, and her interaction with
the adoptive couple Vanessa and Mark Loring (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004950/" title="Jennifer Garner">Jennifer

I am unaware of the bands history, I am sure there were at some point or
another other band members. As of right now it is just him, making this
effectively a one-man- fronted band.</p>
<p>Anyways back to the CD.</p>
<p>Humanistic is a rather dark-feeling album, despite the happy overtones
some of the songs portray. Granted some just put it right out there such
as <em>Monster</em> and <em>Blood</em>, whereas others are more subtle (<em>Start Over</em>
and <em>Never</em> come to mind.) Many ...</p>
