I've been waiting a long time for this.

Pretty much everyone who played the first Portal has been chomping at
the bit for a sequel of sorts to come around. That being said, Portal
was a bit of a sleeper hit (and meme generator). It took a while for it
to become popular. It took even longer for for it to become popular to
release on its own. It did, of course, and I've been the proud owner of
[Portal: Still
Alive](http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-GB/Product/Portal-Still-Alive/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d80258410960 "XBox.com - Portal: Still Alive")
(the XBox 360 release) for a good while now.

So when I heard about a [Portal
2](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002I0J9M0/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&tag=walofscr-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creativeASIN=B002I0J9M0 "Amazon.com - Portal 2 for XBox 360")
coming out, I became very excited (along with a good portion of the
Internet). What's interesting is Portal came out in 2007. There is a 4
year gap between the two games, which is a long time in the game
industry. With that kind of gap, people are going to be expecting a lot
from this release.

So the question is: does it stand up?

Yeup.

it](http://wallofscribbles.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/portal-title-410x256.png "Portal 2 - It's Portal 1, but with way more money invested in it")](http://wallofscribbles.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/portal-title.png)

A friend of mine who happens to be on Steam gained access to [Portal
2](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002I0J9M0/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&tag=walofscr-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creativeASIN=B002I0J9M0 "Amazon.com - Portal 2 for XBox 360")
early due to Valves early release crowd-source thing. A brilliant
marketing scheme, it has to be said. Get loads of people to buy and play
other titles on the Steam network, and they'll release the game that
everyone wants early... maybe.

Brilliant.

Anyways, his description of Portal 2 was two-pronged. The first
statement I got was "It's like Portal, but with money thrown at it." The
second: "It's what Portal really should have been the first time." I
think these two statements sum up Portal 2 almost perfectly. I'd go on
to say that a re-release of the original Portal with the new engine used
in Portal 2 would gain a whole shedload of new sales for Valve. Yes it's
that good.

I should say that this review is based on the single-player experience
of Portal 2. I haven't had a chance to play the co-op mode, so I can't
speak to how amazing that most certainly is. If anyone reading this has
Portal 2 on the Xbox and wants to play, lemme know. When I *do* get a
chance to play the co-op, I'll update this review. Anywho, on with the
review!

Synopsis
--------

[![Certainly glad to see
you](http://wallofscribbles.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/portal-jungle-410x230.jpg "Certainly glad to see you")](http://wallofscribbles.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/portal-jungle.jpg)

You're back in Aperture Laboratories.

After a brief wakeup from your stasis (for tutorial purposes), you're
woken again to a very different scene. You've been asleep a long, *long*
time, and now Wheatley - that's the robot that cares for all the humans
in the facility - is trying to save you from dying. You get a refresher
course on how to use the portal gun, and then you're off the races.

You run into GLaDOS again, and she's just totally psyched to see you
since you killed her 'n all. You get thrown back into the testing ring,
with GLaDOS feeding you back-handed compliments and offering up some of
the best writing ever. You work your way through the tests, until things
get weird, and then they get much, much weirder. I'd explain the whole
thing, but I can't bring myself to spout off any major spoilers because,
honestly, it's so much better to just play the game and experience it.

Gameplay
--------

[Portal
2](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002I0J9M0/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&tag=walofscr-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creativeASIN=B002I0J9M0 "Amazon.com - Portal 2 for XBox 360")
plays out almost exactly the same as the original. The portal gun still
shoots 2 portals, you can still fall from any height, but can't swim.
Also, pretty much everything can kill you. Nothing too surprising there.
The floaty electro-orbs have been removed, in favour of using more of
the *thermal discouragement beams* that you have to aim into targets.
You also get excursion funnels, repulsion/propulsion/conversion gels,
light bridges, cubes for redirecting lasers, and faith plates. Yeah, you
lose the bouncy energy murder balls, but you get a lot more to play
with. I'll try and break it down for you:

### Thermal discouragement beams (and the redirection cubes)

Lasers. Seriously that's what these are. Lasers that go in a straight
line, hurt anything that isn't a cube, and are used to power switches
and the like (just like the bouncy energy balls from the original
Portal). The redirection cubes do exactly that: redirect. Specifically,
they redirect the beams. Straight-forward really, much like the beams.

### Light bridges

They're bridges. Made of light. You can walk on them, block bullets,
etc. It's a wall you can walk on, basically.

### The gels

The gels were probably some of the neatest additions to Portal 2. They
more or less do what they say on the tin. The Repulsion Gel makes you
(or anything else) that hits it bounce. Objects you coat in the blue
stuff will also become high-speed bouncy balls. Propulsion Gel makes you
move fast (somewhat exponentially). Conversion Gel turns any surface
it's a part of into a Portal-friendly surface. This is something I wish
you had access to more often throughout Portal 2, but sadly is rather
limited.

### Excursion Funnels

These are basically levitation tunnels. You go in them (or put anything
into them) and you will be pulled along in the tunnel until you hit a
wall. You can slide out of the tunnel at any point, but you cannot fight
the flow of the tunnel or move faster within it. You can basically only
go sideways.

### Faith plates

These launch you (or other things) through the sky to land on a target
somewhere across the way. These are probably the most terrifying things
you come across in the game, and yet they are the safest thing you're
likely to interact with in the whole game. It's one of the few things in
the game that can't really kill you, since the landing spots are always
the same.

Graphics
--------

In many ways Portal 2 looks like the original Portal. At the very leave
the look 'feels' the same, except it's been polished so goddamned much
it burns an awesome-shaped hole in your *soul*. It looks stunning.
Effects aren't over-done, but look stunning. The lighting is impressive,
and their attention to detail with all of the decay is astounding. The
*views* you get in this game are enough to make you stop and stare. The
Ratman's artworks are back in Portal 2, and these ones are very much of
the 'art' variety. They're worth finding, if only to look upon them and
be moved.

All of the normal elements you interact with in the game have
been obscenely polished as well. Companion cubes hum a little tune and
glow pink in their cores. When you walk into rooms, Panels clean
themselves up. Liquids are really, well, *liquidy*. Everything you
interact with just shines with the effort and love given by the Valve
team.

The writing/storytelling
------------------------

Oh my god the writing. The writing in [Portal
2](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002I0J9M0/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&tag=walofscr-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399349&creativeASIN=B002I0J9M0 "Amazon.com - Portal 2 for XBox 360")
has been on a level beyond professional. The writing in Portal 2
surpassed the writing from the original by a mile. It' probably helped
that there is more than one person to write for, and back and forth
banter is always better than writing monologues at the player. Here are
a small, hopefully not very spoiler-y sample of the brilliance within
Portal 2:

> "Most test subjects do experience some, uh, cognitive deterioration
> after a few months in suspension. Now, you've been under for quite a
> lot longer, and its \*not\* out of the question that you might have a
> \*very\* minor case of serious brain damage! But, don't be alarmed,
> alright? Uh, although, d-do feel alarmed. Try to hold onto that
> feeling, because that is the proper reaction to being told that you've
> got brain damage!" - **Wheatley, upon waking you up from stasis.**
>
> "Well done. Here are the test results: You are a horrible person. I'm
> serious, that's what it says: A horrible person. We weren't even
> testing for that. Don't let that "horrible person" thing discourage
> you. It's just a data point. If it makes you feel any better, science
> has now validated your birth mother's decision to abandon you on a
> doorstep." - **GLaDOS, upon your finishing one of her tests.**
>
> "Most people emerge from suspension terribly undernourished. I want to
> congratulate you on beating the odds and somehow managing to put on a
> few pounds." - **GLaDOS, basically being a bitch.**

This is, of course only the lightest sampling. Much, much better stuff
exists in Portal 2, but to avoid massive spoilers, I've opted not to
include them. The fact that Cave Johnson is voiced by J.K. Simmons
really should be enough to have anyone play. If you're from the UK,
Stephen Merchant does the voice for Wheatley, and he does an amazing job
as well.

Moving beyond the basic banter writing (which is some of the best game
banter I've heard in forever), the story itself is compelling in its
simplicity. You are given a lot of history and a lot of explanations.
The story is paced out perfectly, and you get a lot of closure by
getting through it all.I have to commend the Valve writing staff for
this one. They've always done good work with their writing, but Portal 2
is a work of art in terms of writing and story-telling.

Music
-----

Not much to say with the music in Portal 2. Well, not much that I can
say without giving away even more of the game. What I will say is that
where there is music, it's used to very good effect. Never really
over-bearing, but still helps set the mood of the scene and gets into
your head. Also, do yourself and have a listen to companion cubes, and
the end points for lasers and switches. They all have little tunes that
both delight and annoy.

Issues
------

Nothing I can really say other than one or two of the puzzles just
baffled the crap out of me. I did well overall, but some of them just
had me sitting there wandering aimlessly until I happened to notice some
platform or ledge that I needed to get onto.

My only advice is that as you get further into the Lab, you'd do well to
take a moment and look around (in every direction) and note anything out
of place or interesting. Chances are, you'll need to interact with that
point in order to finish the puzzle. Don't forget you have a zoom option
in Portal 2. Seriously, don't forget that. It'll help.

The other issue is that the single player campaign (as I haven't been
able to get into co-op yet) is shorter than I would have liked. I logged
somewhere between 10-15 hours, and I would have been fine with another
5-10 in there. Then again, maybe the co-op will handle that. I guess
I'll have to wait and see about that.

Oh, and while not actually an issue, this is more of a note: If you
haven't played Portal 1, you do yourself a disservice if you don't play
it before playing Portal 2. You'll still enjoy Portal 2, but you'll be
missing out on a lot of the jokes.

Overall
-------

Brilliant. One of the best games I have played in a *very* long time.
brilliant story, brilliant writing, everything's been polished to a
hefty sheen, and it's basically amazing. You will be doing yourself a
disservice if you don't pick this one up.

9.5/10
