The Last Dodo takes place a bit in the future, where the Doctor and
Martha show up on an artificial planet that features the rarest
creatures in the universe. Literally, the last of (almost) every
creature is kept in this massive Museum of the Last Ones. The Doctor is
horror struck when he sees what's going on, but before he can get into
his tirade he is told that some of the creatures are going missing. Let
the mystery begin.

Though still fairly typical as far as Doctor Who new adventures are
going, this one was entertaining for a couple of reasons. One: it's
actually 3 adventures in one, though I cannot explain that without
giving away too much of the book. Two: Half of the story is actually
told from Martha's point of view in a fourth-wall-breaking sort of way.
Three: it contains one of the creepiest internal thoughts of the Doctors
that I have ever read. And lastly, four: never have I been so impressed
with someone writing from a creatures point of view then I have with
this book. [The
author](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacqueline_Rayner "Jacqueline Rayner")
really makes you feel for the Dodo species.

As far as the new series go, this is the best one I've read.
