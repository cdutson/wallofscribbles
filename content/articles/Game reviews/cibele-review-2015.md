I asked for a game recommendation to play on the plane while I was flying to/from a recent business trip. People suggested Cibele, and so I grabbed it. Within about 5 minutes of playing I realized: _"Nope, I cannot play this on a plane with people around me."_ People don't seem to understand that NSFW also applies to **Planes full of families and children.**

This is not going to be a typical game review. I say this before I get started because, quite frankly, Cibele's not like many games that I've ever experienced.

## Summary
From the [Cibele](http://ninasays.so/cibele/) presskit:

> Cibele is a game based on a true story about love,
> sex, and the internet. You play as a 19 year old 
> girl who has become close with a young man she met
> in an online game. Her relationship with him heats
> up, becoming more and more intimate with each 
> phone call and private chat.

My addition to the above description: you play as a pink-haired woman called Nina. Nina plays an MMO and develops an online relationship with a man called Blake. As the game progresses, you watch the relationship evolve, and the emotions that lay therein. It is a very personal story that you get to watch unfold.

## Graphics

Much like [Contradiction]({filename}contradiction-pneuma-films-2015.md), a lot of [Cibele](http://ninasays.so/cibele/) takes place in an FMV-style, with live action video comprising at least half of the game. The shots are well done, and do a good job of conveying the emotions they're trying to get across. Each shot seemingly purposeful, and while there is more exposed skin than expected, none of it feels out of place or cheap.

The non-video portions of the game are heavily stylized, and whilst cute, can be a bit difficult to look at. There's a lot of pastels and pinks. Not to say that either of those things are bad, but simply that it gets a little straining on the eye. The desktop features a typical anime wallpaper, with a pink ui. The MMO world's colour palette shifts each time you go in. The in-game game has a very particular aesthetic that I think is executed well, though it does play merry havoc with the topography of everything.

## Gameplay

This is where things start going off the rails for a game review. See Cibele's not really a game in the classical sense. It's more a click-through story, where there isn't any branching or decisions to make. Your interactions hold no sway over how the story plays out, but do help prompt things to move along.

The only thing you can do in Cibele is use the mouse to click on things. You can interact with Nina's desktop computer, and to interact with enemies and move around within the MMO. This is also where a surprising amount of depth and most of my uneasiness (which I'll explain in the next section) comes from. Given you don't have much you can do, there's not much telling you to do much of anything. You are free to dig into Nina's computer or not. This singular choice, to poke around or not, can really effect how you feel by the end of the experience.

Simply put, Cibele's not a game. It's a story that masquerades as a game and uses yet another game as a backdrop to tell the story. This isn't a bad thing by any means, as other games such as [Gone Home](http://www.gonehomegame.com/) have been met with critical success. Cibele uses the concept of a game as a medium distilled down to a tool to tell its story. We as a community don't really have a category for these games though. I'd like to qualify them as "interactive stories" but I'm not sure if that'd ever catch on.

## How playing Cibele made me feel

[![Nina, from the presskit]({filename}../../images/cibele-review-2015/cibele3.png){: class=aligncenter }]({filename}../../images/cibele-review-2015/cibele3.png)

Cibele is a story. It's a very raw and very honest story about love, sexuality, and trust. 

I said earlier that you have the option of digging through Nina's computer. It is for the most part an optional activity that serves no purpose other than to let you get into Nina's headspace. If you do decide to dig, you can find blog posts from when she was younger, new and old photos, poetry, emails, etc. The more you view, the more you get to understand Nina. She is very much a normal young woman. She has friends, desires, interests and you can sift through all of them.

I opted to dig around as soon as I started playing because that's what I have been conditioned to do in games. Without a prompt, I will start to poke around to try and find purpose. The consequence of doing this is that you start feeling very much like a voyeur, spying on a young woman. At least that's the feeling I was getting, and I did not like it one bit. There was a real feeling that I was invading Nina's privacy, and that left me feeling uneasy pretty much from the get go.

What I found interesting is that the more I dug, the more distanced from the character I became. I felt less like I was supposed to be the character, and more like a person watching the character. It really set me apart as a third party and it made everything I did feel like I was violating her privacy. This is all the more true as her relationship with Blake, or Ichi, develops. 

Over the course of three acts, Nina and Blake become more intimate (which results in more NSFW material that can be found if you go looking) and their online conversations becoming much more personal. As they talk, flirt, and confess things to one another, I felt that much more the creepy dude, listening from a dark corner. While I empathized with Nina, I was not her, and the further along in the story I got, the worse I felt about observing it. It wasn't my place, and it made me feel _icky._ I had no right to be witness to these people's affairs, and yet that's exactly what the game forces you to do.

And then there's Blake. Blake is a proto-typical **Guy From The Internet<sup>TM</sup>.** He uses schmoozy lines and plays on Nina's insecurities, whether he knows it or not. From their first conversation, I knew where things were going to go, and it skeeved me right out. I was yelling at the screen within 15 minutes of playing.

What makes Blake worse is that he reminds me (and I'm sure many young men from the Internet) of a much younger, much shittier me. A me from before I realized that women were not just breasts and ass; that they were not a puzzle to be solved in order for them to send me some 240x240 jpg of their pixilated boobs. The me I refer to was closer to 15, but Blake is 19 in this game and I personally feel that he should know better. 

When I was younger, I was a typical butt-hurt nice guy, who couldn't understand why girls wouldn't want to be with and complained about the non-existent "friend zone". At the same time, I was a guy who was trying desperately for girls to flash me with all the charm and subtlety of a fog horn in a church. I was a shitty young man, as many were and are. I've learned my lessons since then, and I abhor the young diaper stain that I once was. I'm a better man now, and I endeavour to be better every day.

Blake was and is an unwelcome reminder of the kind of man I used to be. Beyond that, it's a reminder that there's a lot of men who are still out there that act like this even now. Hell, you've only got to do a little digging on the Internet to find all manner of disgusting discussion regarding the premise of this game to see what I'm talking about. There are a lot of guys out there that would defend Blake's actions, or better yet champion them, and that's really depressing to think about.

As soon as Nina and Blake started talking, I could hear a not insignificant amount of young me in his voice. I knew the kind of stuff that was going to come out of his mouth before he said it, and it caused me to feel a slow, mounting horror to the whole situation. No matter how much I cringed, how much I wished I could change the story's trajectory to a happier direction, there was nothing to do but stick it out and watch as everything happened

The final scenes of the game were, to me, heart-breaking. I knew it was coming from the first minutes of playing Cibele, but there was nothing to be done. The decision to end it when it does only makes the whole experience that much more jarring. I know that Nina's story isn't unique, but it is very hard to watch it raw and real right in front of your eyes. The unanswered questions and feelings, the lack of resolution in the game make it all the more poignant.

## Overall

Overall Cibele stuck with me. 

It made me feel like a creepy voyeur, as I watched Nina take photos of herself or dug through her computer. It made me sad to so personally know how mine or another's shitty actions can hurt another person. It filled me with a quiet horror as I watched things unfold that I could not change. It made me feel ashamed for my actions as a younger man, and ashamed that those actions probably aren't all that unique. It left me uncomfortable with it's unanswered questions and notions.

Cibele made me feel a lot of emotions, and for that it's worth the purchase.
