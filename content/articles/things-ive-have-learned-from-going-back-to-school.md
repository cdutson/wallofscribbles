So a while back I mentioned [going back to
school](/2008/07/28/i-got-into-school/ "WallOfScribbles.com: I got into school for graphic design").
In fact, I even recall writing a
[collection](/2007/11/21/designapalooza-part-one/ "WallOfScribbles.com: Designapalooza Part 1")
[of](/2007/11/23/designapalooza-part-two/ "WallOfScribbles.com: Designapalooza Part 2")
[articles](/2007/11/26/designapalooza-part-three/ "WallOfScribbles.com: Designapalooza Part 3")
[all](/2007/12/03/designapalooza-part-four/ "WallOfScribbles.com: Designapalooza Part 4")
[about](/2007/12/19/designapalooza-part-five/ "WallOfScribbles.com: Designapalooza Part 5")
[the](/2008/01/16/designapalooza-part-six/ "WallOfScribbles.com: Designapalooza Part 6")
[subject](/2008/06/05/designapalooza-part-seven/ "WallOfScribbles.com: Designapalooza Part 7").
I'm sure I've mentioned it in my
[twitter](http://www.twitter.com/Corey%20Dutson "Twitter.com: Corey Dutson")
(or at the very least, bitched about it). Well unlike the real world,
College gives you large, void-filled breaks between semesters. This
allows people like me ample time to run out of excuses for things we
should have either done, or been doing during the academic time frame.

In my case this revolves around:

-   My portfolio
-   Posts with real content
-   Reading books
-   Spending time with Theresa while she is down from <span
    style="text-decoration: line-through;">that god-forsaken
    place</span> North Bay.
-   Aimlessly trying to catch up on my games

Now since only a couple of those are actually proactive (I'll leave you
to decide which) I have to pick and choose what and when I do these
things. What is the result? Well to give you a glimpse, it's almost 2 AM
as of the start of this post. This is after I applied to many, *many*
bursaries through my school. Who knew that working two jobs wouldn't be
enough to actually stay out of debt? Guess I'll have to get some more!

My financial woes are not what I plan to talk about today though. I plan
to talk about what I can take away from my first semester.

Okay, technically this would be my seventh semester if you are counting
the six from the last time I was in school. That is also part of this so
read on!

### 1. Being lazy sucks

This may come as a shock to some of you, but I was not always a star
pupil. Oh no, in fact I used to revel in my ability to half-ass almost
any project and end up with a 65-70 (that's a C to a B- to the rest of
the world) on any given assignment or project. If I didn't like the
course, I would try even less and be happy with a 55-58 (D to D+). My
parents browbeat me, my teachers clucked their tongues and shook their
heads, but I just breezed though my University-level (that's Canadian
fancy-talk for advanced) courses. By doing the University-level courses
and applying to College, my average was bumped up considerably, and I
got into College.

So you would think that since my parents were paying, and I had just
managed to squeak by, that I would learn the error of my ways,
straighten-up and fly right.

You would think ***wrong***, of course.

By the end of my college stint, with the exception of a couple of
classes (Web Development 1,2 and 3 pretty much) I was still hovering
around that 70. The only thing that landed me the job that I got was
through determination, charisma, and steaming piles of luck.

This kind of thing only works so well and for so long.

Working this job changed a lot of things. First, I learned how to stay
up for long periods of time. Second, I learned to hate take-out food
(don't worry I'm getting better now). Third, it beat the lazy out of me
with the Crowbar of Client Dead-lines. I learned that being lazy when
***people are paying you*** is a very good way to get your ass *fired*.
I wasn't fired, but believe me that there was no alternative to hard
work. In many ways I am thankful for this.

When the opportunity came along for me to go back to school for
something that interests me way more than keyboard-jockeying, I took it.
With that decision came many things in quick succession:

1.  Getting a second job
2.  Saving like a bastard
3.  Tuition, books, and other school bills
4.  Losing my full-time, nicely-waged job
5.  Homework
6.  More goddamned bills
7.  Tests, presentations, and apparently a video

If this had happened the first time I went through school, I probably
would have killed myself, my family, or everyone I know in a murderous
rage by now. Thankfully, through my on-the-job experience, I had learned
how to organize my work, get it done, and still manage to find time to
sleep.

I'd like to point out that because if this skill, I have managed to work
two jobs while maintaining an average of 90% + overall so far. I don't
know how to explain this any better than I already have: being lazy
sucks. If you have issues with being lazy, procrastinating, or otherwise
messing-about, believe me that you have to work constantly against those
urges. I have to all the time, but in the end you only screw yourself if
you get lazy.

### 2. Keep your stuff safe

[Dropbox](http://www.getdropbox.com/ "Get Dropbox"). I love
[Dropbox](http://www.getdropbox.com/ "Get Dropbox"). I could sing
praises for this system for hours. Well okay, probably more like 15
minutes max, but that's not the point here.
[Dropbox](http://www.getdropbox.com/ "Get Dropbox") allows you to
synchronize files within a certain directory (the
[Dropbox](http://www.getdropbox.com/ "Get Dropbox") folder, shockingly)
to their web servers. What does this mean? It means that everything in
that folder can be accessed through their online web interface. and what
does *that* mean? It means that if your are ever separated from your
computer, your computer explodes, or anything in between you can still
get to the files stored on their servers. You can also hook multiple
computers into the same account, and it will sync the files between them
as well. This allows you to share files between computers that may not
be anywhere near the same network.

I'm not trying to sell you anything (it's actually a free for the basic
level), but it does assist in my point. Keeping your stuff safe is as
important when it comes to school as it does ot your home. Thankfully, I
didn't have any horrible experiences with exploding computers or file
separation, but it was still a good practice. By using this system, I
safeguard myself against very bad situations. Colleges and Universities
really don't care all that much of your personal plights. In fact many
teachers I've had I've overheard them say "well that sucks, too bad."

You can't stop every bad thing from happening, but you can take
preventative measures.

### 3. Organization actually works.

I hate organizers. I still do! With their paper and their spiral
binding, bah! Thankfully, I found alternatives that work. As it happens,
I use
[Thunderbird](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/products/thunderbird/ "Mozilla.org: Thunderbird").
The nice thing about Thunderbird, much like Firefox, is the ability to
use add-ons.
[Lightning](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/releases/lightning0.9.html "Mozilla.org: Lightning")
(an add-on version of
[Sunbird](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/sunbird/ "Sunbird"))
and a [Provider for Google
Calendars](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/sunbird/addon/4631 "Mozilla.org: Provider for Google Calendar")
have allowed me to get my shit together without the use of those silly
paper-based organizers.

Please note that I have met many people who prefer the paper-based
organizers: I was basically born with a mouse in my hand, so I'm
inclined to use technology whenever possible. It's a failing I live
with.

In any case,
[Lightning](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/releases/lightning0.9.html "Mozilla.org: Lightning")
allows you to have a calendar built into Thunderbird. It also provides
an interface to create tasks as well, though I don't use those. The
[Google Calendar
plugin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/sunbird/addon/4631 "Mozilla.org: Provider for Google Calendar")
allows you to use
[Lightning](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/releases/lightning0.9.html "Mozilla.org: Lightning")
with [Google Calendars](http://calendar.google.com "Google: Calendar").
This means that much like the
[Dropbox](http://www.getdropbox.com/ "Get Dropbox") argument, you can
still access your calendars if your computer explodes. I have made a
personal, work, homework/assignment, and school schedule calendars. For
the first time, I actually know what things are due when, and how to
schedule my time around work and other things. It's silly to think that
it took me this long to figure out that organizing things actually helps
get things done faster.

If you don't use
[Thunderbird](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/products/thunderbird/ "Mozilla.org: Thunderbird"),
[Google Calendars](http://calendar.google.com "Google: Calendar"), or
[computers in
general](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite "Wikipedia: Luddite"), you
can still work to get yourself organized. I can honestly say that once I
introduced the organizer strategy,

### 4.Go that extra mile

I spent five hours working  on a typography exercise that involved me
making an apple. Five hours of tweezers, 12 point font, and rubber
cement. Sounds insane, doesn't it? Well, it probably does but it also
shows a determination to really put out something that is more than
"alright."

This one comes with at least some backup facts. I've only got three of
my marks back (out of six), but everything has been above a 90. I've
been known to spend hours and hours on things that others have put
together in one or two. Does that mean I'm overdoing it? Very probably,
I have no illusions that I may be going well beyond the call of duty
here. That is also my point though: Spending that extra time can (in
most cases) result in a more polished product.

This is something I've learned over time. Back when I was lazy, I was
the master of doing everything last-minute. This wasn't a lack of
organization or anything, I chose to do everything at the last minute
because part of me felt that I operated best under the pressure. As it
turns out, I do *alright* under pressure and there is nothing wrong with
that. But I do *amazingly well*, as it turns out, when I have the extra
time to self-critique, improve, revise, and even experiment.

Is there anything wrong with only spending two hours on something and
getting a 75% (B) on what you did? Not at all, if what you're looking
for is a 75%. Since that's no where near what I want out of the
education I am paying for (and it's not cheap, though I'm sure there are
some angry University students that would love to talk to me), I have to
put in the extra time myself. I want to be the best I can, and school
only gives you the tools in which to do that; it's up to you to use them
to the best of your ability.

### 5. Don't be a Dick

*Note: I am so sorry for the amount of times 'dick' comes up in this
section. This is going to play havoc with my SEO.*

This sounds simple, but it's actually harder than one would think. The
issue is that it goes two ways, and it's easy to act like a dick when
you don't even realize:

#### Being the Dick

This is pretty simple. If you act like a dick, you are being the dick.
Acting like a dick can be, but is not limited to the following:

-   Boasting about any/everything you do.
-   Trying to out-boast anyone else (they may be dicks, but you're a
    bigger one).
-   Rubbing marks in peoples face.
-   Saying how awesome you are at something, and then criticizing the
    teacher (publicly).
-   Being snooty, arrogant, or otherwise acting "better" than others.
-   Making fun of people (grow the fuck up kthnx).
-   Picking fights, either physical or mental.

When you do things like this, it may make you feel better. It may make
you feel confident and self-assured. It will make everyone around you
loathe whenever you open your word hole. Friends that you have will come
to resent you, and you will end up with fewer contacts coming out of
school, and less leway with people when it's needed.

#### Returning the Dickness

This is the one people don't realize. you may think that "an eye for an
eye" is a good mandate to follow, but when other people want to start
gouging your eyes out, there's an issue. Here are easy ways to return
the dickness without realizing it:

-   Trying to shut up a dick by attacking their person, ability, etc.
-   Trying to out boast someone to shut them up/put them in their place
    (once again, you are the bigger dick).
-   Faux modesty (you're not fooling anyone).
-   Following suit with a dick (joining in with mocking,
    criticizing etc.).
-   Being a dick to a dick because their a dick.

Some of those are fairly obvious, but a couple are less obvious.

Trying to act modest just annoys people. You're really not fooling
anyone. When someone gives you a compliment, take it, and return
something in kind. Don't elaborate on your greatness, nor say that you
suck and don't know how you got the mark you did. That will make them
feel even worse, they'll think you're a liar, and you may even start to
believe it yourself. Undermining your own self-confidence doesn't help
anyone.

When being a dick towards a dick, you may think you are giving them a
taste (heh) of their own medicine. You may know what you're doing, but
those around you may not perceive it the same way; they may just see two
dicks trying to out-dick one another. On top of that, the dick you are
being a dick to may not even realize you are being a dick towards them.
The result of this is that you look like a dick, but got none of the
supposed revenge.

#### Not being the Dick

This should be fairly apparent, but for the sake of completeness, I will
include a list for this anyways. I'm always a fan of things being
full-circle. Anyways, how to not be a dick:

-   Be helpful. When people ask for help, help them if you can.
-   Give constructive criticism. "That sucks" isn't doing anyone
    any good. "You could try doing this for this reason" will glean a
    much better reception.
-   Be kind. Don't rip on people when something isn't good. You can be
    kind with constructive criticism as much as you can
    with compliments.
-   Accept compliments, and return in kind.
-   Don't single people out to rip on them. It doesn't help anyone.
-   Be courteous. There's nothing wrong with "please" and "thank you".

Generally to avoid being a dick, you have to be a generally good and
nice person. I'm not saying I exhibit all of these traits (far from,
really); what I'm saying is that you should *try* to exhibit as many as
you can. It's a process of continuous improvement.

### 6. Do your work

This doesn't even need a large section, and by all accounts it shouldn't
really have to be on here. Make time to do your work, and for crap sake,
***do your work***. I can't tell you how many people I know in my
section that lost marks simply because they didn't do assignment.
Generally speaking, you cannot lose marks for trying. If you don't hand
something in, you get a zero. If you hand in crap, you can get a one.
One is infinitely better than zero (quiet, math nerds), and handing
assignments in can only help your cause.

It is this point that probably caused most of my lost marks. Many
assignments in my last stint in College went completely undone; ignored
for the sake of ignoring them. I can't honestly say that I even had
better things to do because I was just lazy back then. Teachers even
told me that if I just handed something in, it would help my marks, but
I scoffed at their wisdom, and ended up (in some cases) with a 58%. I
have no defense for it, and now I understand what they were saying.

### 7. Figure out how to study

This one was probably the hardest for me, and of course it is also the
point that gave me the most. It was by a freak accident that I found out
how to study effectively. I was in the school lounge one day when
someone asked me if I had studied for the test. "What test?" I responded
(this is before the organizer thing). I then had two hours to learn
1/3rd of my textbook. It may sound insane, but I figured out a process
of reading and constant quizzing is actually how I learned best. I've
refined it a bit since then, and it now involves me writing the points
down, highlighting them, force memorizing them, and having people quiz
me on things in random order. By the end of the session I will have
forgotten my name, my address, and how to drive, but God damn do I know
the course material.

I never used to be this way. I used to depend entirely on my ability to
recall from memory. As it turns out that works, but it's not 100% for
me. By combining my passive ability with active studying, I can make
sure I know what I need to.

I'm not saying that this will work for you. Hell, some people would look
at my method and crap themselves. Others would look at this (my
girlfriend comes to mind) and say that it's not nearly enough. I'm not
here to sell my method, though if it works for you go nuts, I'm simply
saying that studying is worth it in the end.  Find the best way for you
to study, and go for it. It might take a couple takes to get it right,
but there's a way for everyone.

### 8. Take time to relax

At first glance, you would think that this point would directly contrast
others that I have made. You would be *wrong*, but I can *totally*
understand how you would do that. Let me explain:

Taking time for yourself is not being lazy, it is not skipping out on
work, and it is not aiming for the average. It can be if your relaxation
time is way too large, and causes those points to happen. It all comes
down to balance with relaxation time. All work and no play make jack a
dull boy. It's very true, you know. When you don't take time for
yourself, you will eventually become frustrated, irritable, and probably
end up shooting the mailman.

Taking time to relax and recharge has benefits that I don't need to
voice. I'm sure a brief search on the Internet will tell you more than I
ever could. It makes you feel better, which will help you work better.
It also takes your mind off of things, which can result in you having a
flash of brilliance on a problem you were having. I've always found that
taking an hour for a bath and a book (shut up, I don't need to hear what
a wuss I sound like) leaves me feeling way better.

I'm sure I'm missing many points that I could probably rig up, but after
3000 words, I'm running out of brain and witty banter. I hope that my
points on my education can help, maybe even educate, some others. If you
have your own points to add, feel free to comment with them.
