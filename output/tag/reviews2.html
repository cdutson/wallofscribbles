<p>The whole CD has a slightly surreal feel to it, but that's probably
because of the slight Emo (yes I'm aware that current Emo is not real
Emo) feel and lyrics that are spread throughout the songs. I'm not
saying that they're depressing, but many of the tracks tend to put me
into more of a reflective mood then say, a slap-happy moshing mood. What
I noticed from the first song, and what permeates the ...</p>

I am sorry to everyone who was around me who was also trying to watch

<p>The book is quite literally about what it says it is about: <em>The life

about. The book centres around the life of Elphaba, the green-skinned,
sharp-featured and sharp-tongued girl who would one day be the Wicked
Witch of the West, and who would be felled by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Gale" title="Dorothy Gale">young girl from

book is split into different stages of Elphaba's life and seem more like
snippets rather than entire sections. I had to admit that I was

<p>Just to clarify: Abandoned Pools is a project by Tommy Walter and though
I am unaware of the bands history, I am sure there were at some point or
another other band members. As of right now it is just him, making this
effectively a one-man- fronted band.</p>
<p>Anyways back to the CD.</p>
<p>Humanistic is a rather dark-feeling album, despite the happy overtones
some of the songs portray. Granted some just put it right out there such
as <em>Monster</em> and <em>Blood</em>, whereas others are more subtle (<em>Start Over</em>

is for the most part, a rather enjoyable game. Released in October of
2005 (if you live in North America as I do) this game became an instant
hit and flew off the shelves. Now granted I waited two years before
playing it (since then a second game has come out, and there are a third
and fourth in existence somewhere) but only because I have only recently
bought a DS. I have to make sure to buy my friend Dane a decorative cake
for lending me his copy.</p>

<p>This cd has a lot of hip-hop influence, no matter how much the band may
or may not deny it. At least three tracks have clap tracks, and more
then one has what I call "thug beat." I'm not saying these are totally
horrible traits as it is nice to see a better mix of the genrés then

family goes down hill. Mom develops a Valium addiction, the older
brother becomes angsty, and dad just distances himself from his
feelings. I'm not giving away plot twists here, merely the story line.

life trying to make it ...</p>

<p>The piano and drums are featured heavily throughout the tracks, though I
use 'heavily' in a loose sense. What I mean to say is they are the

goes throughout his life, and it's narrated in first person so you get
all of his thoughts as they go. You also get to read about his having
sex, wanting to have sex, jerking off, wishing to jerk off, or some sort
of combination of all the previous activities for about 60% of the book.
This may sound like a pathetic excuse for a novel, but if you take all
the satire out of it, you will realize that guys think about sex on a
