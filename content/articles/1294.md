Synopsis
--------

talk about the story, cover the types?

[![He's goddamned
insane](http://wallofscribbles.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/jackass-410x256.jpg "Handsome Jack - the sociopath hero")](http://wallofscribbles.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/jackass.jpg)

Gameplay
--------

second verse, same as the first. Badass ranking

[![LOOK AT ME WHEN I'M CHARGING AT
YOU](http://wallofscribbles.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/bandits-410x230.jpg "bandits - still short on words")](http://wallofscribbles.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/bandits.jpg)

Sounds/Music
------------

better choice for intro/outro music, still sick of people saying the
same couple phrases

[![The answer is
no.](http://wallofscribbles.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/lurkers-410x230.jpg "Lurkers - ain't they cute?")](http://wallofscribbles.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/lurkers.jpg)

Issues
------

Cars still have the worst physics, clipping issues, underwelming boss
battle (in contrast to other bosses)

Extra goodies
-------------

label off the items as they are, haven't played them yet though. Will
update when played.

[![High five,
minion!](http://wallofscribbles.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/goddamned-claptrap-410x230.jpg "GREETINGS MINION")](http://wallofscribbles.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/goddamned-claptrap.jpg)

Overall
-------

7/10
