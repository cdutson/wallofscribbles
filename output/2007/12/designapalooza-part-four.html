<h3 id="swag">Get Your Swag On</h3>
<p>First thing's first, get your twitchy little fingers on your tools of
choice. Where to start? Good question. Since I know I'm going to be
using a lot of the Adobe family, I'll be working with them as my
example. Don't be shocked if the program you want has a fully functional
free trial available. All of Adobe has this, and I'm sure they're not
alone.</p>
<p>Here is a list of products that Adobe offers that you can get free
trails of:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.adobe.com/cfusion/tdrc/index.cfm?product=fireworks" title="Adobe Fireworks CS3">Fireworks CS3<br />
</a>This
    is my program of choice at the moment. It works much more with
    vectors (though in no way is it limited from bitmap) and is what I
    am using for my website design pieces. My reasons for this
    are two-fold. First, it is the program my workplace uses for all of
    our designing, and therefor is worth learning if only for
    practicality reasons. Second, It's gradient/vector happy, and though
    I feel that
    <a href="http://tutorialblog.org/wide-web-20-style/" title="Web 2.0">2.0</a> is a
    style that is being beaten to death far too fast some of it's
    aspects are solid. <a href="https://www.adobe.com/cfusion/tdrc/index.cfm?product=fireworks" title="Adobe Fireworks CS3"><br />
</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.adobe.com/cfusion/tdrc/index.cfm?product=flash" title="Adobe Flash CS3 Professional">Flash CS3 Professional<br />
</a>It's flash.
    I don't think I need to get to much into this. If you do web
    development, this is at least worth a cursory glance. There will
    probably come a time when your customer will want flash in their
    solution, and you'll have to do it whether you want to or not. It's
    come a long way since I've used it (last time
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromedia" title="Macromedia">Macromedia</a>
    had just come out with Flash MX)<a href="https://www.adobe.com/cfusion/tdrc/index.cfm?product=flash" title="Adobe Flash CS3 Professional"><br />
</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.adobe.com/cfusion/tdrc/index.cfm?product=illustrator" title="Adobe Illustrator CS3">Illustrator CS3<br />
</a>Vector
    drawing to the max. This program is pure vector imaging and works
    great with type. This is a great tool to have if you are doing print
    or web, as it allows you to create <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics" title="Vector Graphics">vector-based
    graphics</a>
    which allow for way more flexibility in your reuse library. I have
    not used it much, and so I cannot give it the credit it is
    probably due.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.adobe.com/cfusion/tdrc/index.cfm?product=photoshop" title="Adobe Photoshop CS3">Photoshop CS3<br />
</a>Who
    can forget the classics? Photoshop has been around for as long as I
    have been on the Internet. <a href="http://xkcd.com/331/" title="Internet lol.">Countless jokes
    exist</a> of people
    "Photoshopping" images and thousands of Internet Memes exist as a
    result of its existence. Getting past that, Photoshop is a fantastic
    tool which offers so much in functionality that most people don't
    even know it exists. The only limitation with this program is that
    it is a bitmap-based program. I am sure there is the ability to work
    with vectors, but I have yet to really play with or even find that.
    Like I said previously, I use Fireworks for my vector work. I don't
    need to sing the praises of this program though, since it's utter
    integration into Internet society should state that it does it's job
    well enough.</li>
<li>And a <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/" title="Adobe Products">whole list of
    programs</a>, most/all
    of which have fully functioning trials.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the other listed programs, ArtRage 2 has a
<a href="http://www.ambientdesign.com/artragedown.html" title="ArtRage 2 Free">free</a><a href="http://www.ambientdesign.com/artragedown.html" title="ArtRage 2 Free">version</a>
available, though it is locked down and does not have all the features
available. I suggest downloading the free version and trying it out. If
you enjoy it, you may as well <a href="http://www.ambientdesign.com/artragepurchase.html" title="ArtRage 2 for 25 dollars">spend the 25
bucks</a>
for the license. (That's gone up since I last checked. I used to be
like, 18 or so. Yay capitalism.) If you really like it, you can get the
40 dollar version which comes with a manual, tutorials and videos.</p>
<p><a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/mform?siteID=123112&amp;id=10083915" title="3ds Max">3ds
Max</a>
and
<a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&amp;id=7639525" title="Maya Personal Learning Edition">Maya</a>
both have trial versions available, and so If you are going to be using
these (I have seen tutorials that do to get some sexy effects) then you
can at least play around with them here. I've never used them myself, so
I don't know the learning curve but I can imagine them starting off easy
and getting progressively more complex as you get into them.</p>
<p><a href="#toc">Back to top</a><br />
<!--adsense--></p>
<h3 id="man">Man the Helm</h3>
<p>Now that you've got your weapons of choice selected, it's time to use
them. My personal experience has taught me to open the program without
looking at the manual, and just screw around. Learn the controls and see
what you can create. It'll probably look like hell, and that's okay.
Screw around and see what you come up with on your own. The point here
is to wet your feet a little, and get a feel for the program. I'm still
getting used to Fireworks, and I've been using it for at least a month
now.</p>
<p>The reason I suggest this is just from my personal experience. I tend to
learn better by figuring out the controls myself. Sure I need guidance
with the obtuse controls, but I commit things to memory far better when
I do it myself. Some people learn better from instruction or reading,
and that's cool too. I am merely pointing out the method of learning
which works best for my brain.</p>
<p>Try not to get upset when the programs or the results created therein.
Remember that you've only just started working with the tool, and no one
expects you to be a savant. If you don't like what you see, ask yourself
why and then try and create it again so that you know how to avoid it in
the future. Screwing up is only screwing up if you don't learn from it.</p>
<p><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></p>
<h3 id="suck">Learn How Not to Suck</h3>
<p>Now that you've created some horrible works of art it's time to learn
from your peers, who are in this case most likely your betters in the
field. for this, I've compiled a small (and in no way complete) list of
sites you can go to for a little knowhow.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.psdtuts.com/" title="PSDTuts">PSDTuts.com</a> - This is probably
    the must user friendly site for Photoshop tutorials I've ever found.
    Throw in the fact that the site is actually pretty stunning to look
    at, and that certainly adds to the trust level. I subscribed to
    their feed a while back, and I have yet to even think about
    regretting it.</li>
<li><a href="http://firetuts.com/" title="Firetuts">Firetuts.com</a> - This is a brand
    new tutorial site that works specifically with Fireworks. Since it's
    new it lacks in content at the moment, but If they keep it up for a
    year, they'll be a reservoir of information for Fireworks users. I
    don't see why they need to say that they're trying to prove it can
    do much of what Photoshop can do, since the two products are really
    supposed to be used for two different task-sets... but regardless,
    they're off to a strong start and worth paying attention to.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.fireworkszone.com/" title="Fireworkszone">Fireworkszone.com</a> -
    Another site the specialized in Fireworks. They cover a couple
    techniques that are more advanced, and so I have yet to touch them.
    They seem fairly hardcore though.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.flashkit.com/tutorials/" title="Flash Kit">Flash Kit.com</a> - It
    blows my mind to think that this website has been around for
    so long. It was old when I was new to all of this. If you have any
    questions about Flash, this is where to start. Seriously, start here
    and I doubt you will need to go anywhere else.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ndesign-studio.com/" title="N.Design Studio">N.Design
    Studio</a> - Not only
    is it a stunning-looking website, but it also features many
    tutorials for Illustrator, Icon packs, and even Wordpress Themes. It</li>
</ul>
<p>And just because I can, I'm going to link
<a href="http://www.andrewingram.net/articles/gridmaker_for_fireworks/" title="GridMaker">GridMaker</a>.
It's not perfect, and doesn't work across many versions of Photoshop and
Fireworks, but any tool you can use to speed up your own production is a
good one. I've used this myself and it works like a dream. Now I'm using
it on Fireworks 8, so I don't know what happens in the other versions.
There is also a <a href="http://www.andrewingram.net/articles/gridmaker_reboot/" title="GridMaker Reboot">Photoshop
version</a>,
though the functionality has changed from its
<a href="http://www.andrewingram.net/articles/introducing_gridmaker/" title="GridMaker v1.0">original</a>.</p>
