Okay, maybe I'm just going insane, but I'm pretty sure there has been a
sharp increase in raspberry-flavoured goods.

I've always been a fan of the raspberry, with its tartness and sweetness
working in perfect harmony. As a child I used to eat raspberry jam (a
rare treat in my house) straight; bread and peanut butter took time to
combine into the regulated sandwich. I consumed it far too quickly,
which is probably why It was such a real treat in my house. In order to
supply me with a constant supply probably would have required second
mortgage on our home.

As I aged, my cravings died down, though I continued to have a deep
longing for raspberry-esque food products. For a long time there was
nothing. I am excluding the occasional sour candy that opted for
mis-representing raspberries, which I would eat and then be unimpressed
with their piddly attempt at deliciousness.

Then something changed. I'm not sure where or when, but something
changed. I didn't really notice at first; a cran-raspberry blend here
and there, [raspberry Voortman
cookies](http://www.voortman.com/cookies7.html "Voortman  cookies").
Overall nothing special. Then one one trip to North Bay to see Theresa,
a [Tim Hortons](http://www.timhortons.com/en/index.html "Tim Hortons")
along the way was selling rasberry-filled donuts *and* TimBits. My mind
was blown. Suffice it to say I bought both and consumed them, nearly
vibrating with joy that the flavour had found it into the proper
channels.



A little later I noticed other raspberry-flavoured foods showing up.
Suddenly every drink that wanted to be trendy was including raspberries
in them. Alcohol has had a recent influx of [raspberry
booze](http://www.drinksmixer.com/desc1335.html "Smirnoff Raspberry Twist Vodka").
Hell I've come across many raspberry-flavoured drinks recently in a
variety of styles. Juice, sparkling, crammed full of caffeine. All
delicious. I've seen gums coming out with raspberry as their proud
banner. I've even found a recent influx in raspberry-imbued muffins and
other confectioneries.

I'm not complaining here people, far from. I'm now living a taste bud
utopia where I can enjoy raspberry in more than in conjunction with
cranberries, their evil counterpart. I'm truly happy that raspberrys are
finally mainstream.

My question is why? Why now, after all this time, is it becoming a
normal food product? What happened to the mystery and misunderstanding
that once surrounded raspberries? Did someone manage to create the
perfect artificial flavour of it? Did someone recently stumble upon an
endless field of raspberries trapped in a mountain pass somewhere that
we are now exploiting?

I'm happy about the increase in raspberry-related goods, but I wish I
knew why there was an increase to begin with.
