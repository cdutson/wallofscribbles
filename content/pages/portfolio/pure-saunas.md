Summary: I was commissioned to create a new logo for a distributor of infrared saunas’ re-branding . This logo had to give off a calm feeling, while still remaining unique against other distributors. I also had to make sure to keep the target audience in mind. While no colours or fonts were specifically laid out, I was told that there were aiming for blue, and wanted a typeface that was edgy, but wouldn't alienate their potential clients.

with the client, we worked through many iterations of the
logo, refining the idea until it really meshed with the clients vision.
The original concept was actually in the red spectrum and featured a
water droplet in the middle. We rotated through colours until we found a
blue that really worked. After some discussion, the water droplet was,
well, dropped because the client felt that the water droplet may have
been misleading, as the saunas are infrared and not traditional
water-based saunas.

The choice of font was an interesting one, and I went through a decent
number of families until I found one that worked. I was looking for
something modern, and a bit techy without it being overbearing or
obviously digital.  The that comes with the font is actually rotated to
point upwards, but it was eventually straightened out as a client
request.

The end result was a logo that gives the distributor their own
personality, while giving off a calm feeling that worked well with the
angle they were going for.
