This album has been somewhat of a detachment from his other works, and I
was intrigued. As it turns out there's [quite a story to this
one](http://www.matthewgood.org/biography-hospital-music/ "Matthew Good talks about Hospital Music"),
which actually goes on to explain why the album is called what it is,
and why the music sounds the way it does. I've got to say that it takes
balls to make an entire album that does nothing but face your demons.
Apparently, for Matt Good the result is a solid, if not depressing,
album.

The tempo for the whole CD seems to be set to "slow" and never gets
faster than "almost four-four." The music is very minimalist, and it's
obvious every one of these tracks were originally written with the help
of a guitar and nothing else. Other instruments have obviously been
added, and added with a skill that only someone who's been in the
business for a while could do. I actually had the chance to watch a
small live spot of Matt Good at the recent
[CASBY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CASBY_Award "CASBY Awards") awards,
and it was probably some of the best music I've heard live. Sadly he
only played a couple songs, but god damn they were good. They were also
all from this album so that's a bonus.

As stated, this album has a bit of a depressed feeling about it, and
it's prevalent throughout the entire track listing. It's not something
you want to listen to when you're in a good mood, but I have to say that
it will fit in really well with an sort of sullen or relaxed mood. I
find it's great music when I want to feel creative. I don't know why,
but it seems to work for me. The vocals are for the most part as toned
down as the music itself, though a couple tracks ("Born Losers" and "I'm
A Window" come to mind) feature an exceptionally clear and strong vocal
track.

I suggest picking this one up of you're into Matthew Good, or if you
just like a good solid album that happens to be someones soul on
display. It's not for everyone, but those who like it will truly like it
a lot.

8/10
