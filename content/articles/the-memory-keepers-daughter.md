[The Memory Keeper's
Daughter](http://www.memorykeepersdaughter.com/purchase_the_book.html "Purchase The Memory Keeper's Daughter")
spans over 40 years of the Henrys family history. When David Henrys wife
gives birth to twins, he is overjoyed, until he realizes that one, a
girl, has [Down
Syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome "Wikipedia: Down Syndrome").
In a split-second decision, he hands his new-born daughter to his Nurse
and tells her to take her to an institution for those with Downs. He
does so thinking that what he is doing for the best, but the decision
will go on to haunt him for the rest of his life. The nurse, Caroline,
also makes a split-second decision and takes the child to Philadelphia
and starts a new life. As the years go by, David and his wife grow more
and more distant as the secret slowly tears at the fabric of their
family life. As they unravel, unable to stop what has been set in
motion, everyone must find their own way in life.

The first couple chapters were a bore. I'll admit that it took me nearly
a month to get through the first 100 or so pages. After that point
(somewhere around there anyways) the book hooked me, and I finished the
rest in record timing. The story is fluid and interesting, but also
quietly sad. It's an interesting point of view to take; watching as a
father who meant to only do good, cause so much sadness and separation.
The time-line is easy to follow, for the most part. I had a bit of
trouble picturing the characters at their correct age, though that is
partially my own fault for not noting the dates in the book.  
<!--adsense-->  
What really got me about this book is the silent controversy that it
inspires. To give away ones child seems utterly barbaric, and yet he was
honestly doing what he thought was best. Children with Downs Syndrome
did not have a very good survival rate in 1964, and he was trying to
spare his wife the pain that would ensue from raising a child with
Downs. On the flip side, he did give their daughter away, and then lie
(and continue to lie) about that action through the entire novel. Was he
right to do it? I won't answer that, because I feel that our past
actions dictate who we are now. He did what he did, and he lived with
it. I personally respect that, regardless of the consequences.

I must also sing praises to Ms. Edwards for bringing to light how hard
it was for those raising Down Syndrome children. Parents had to fight
for every right that they felt their child should have. Proper health
care, public education, employment, and the list goes on. The struggle
that Caroline goes through to raise Phoebe is an impressive read in and
of itself. Package that with the fact that there was an uneasy, yet deep
connection between Caroline and David because of their daughter, and you
get a true understanding of just how hard their lives really were.

The novel also shows that though mentally slower than normal people,
those who have Down Syndrome are no less entitled to things in life.
Their achievements, though possibly smaller-seeming to 'normal' people,
are in fact no more or less significant than any other persons
achievements.

I wasn't expecting this book to be nearly as good as it was, and I'm
thankful for that. It's not a book for everyone because it can drag on
at times, and the chapter sizes are epic to say the least. Either way
it's a proud addition to my shelf, and I'm a little sad to see the end
of it.

7.5/10
