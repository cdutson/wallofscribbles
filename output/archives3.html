management was... well that's where this story comes in. I won't name

his lazy god-damned-ass and is going to start writing words in sequence

make sentences. These sentences, when grouped into logical sections

<p>So yeah I'll admit that it's been a while since I've updated (roughly
two months for those sharpening their pitchforks) and I could say that I
was super busy what with my end of year projects totally consumed my

<a href="http://graphicriver.net/?ref-Corey%20Dutson" title="GraphicRiver.net">GraphicRiver</a>,
a forum thread came up that basically outlined the following:
"<strong><em>PHOTOSHOP IS SO SLOW WHY GOD WHY?</em></strong>" In further investigation the
author did admit he had some aging hardware, which really should be
addressed.</p>
<p>For those of us - myself included - that cannot simply afford to drop

her friend at a time that allowed little error in me driving 1.5 hours
to get to the theater. I arrived with about 6 minutes to spare, and
though it probably cost me a mint in gas (not to mention the 10 dollar
