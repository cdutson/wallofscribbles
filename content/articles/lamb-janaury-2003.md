Lamb is about Jesus' life as told by his best-friend, Biff, who has been
brought back to life by Raziel the airhead Angel. Apparently the Bible
is in dire need of revision and the powers that be wanted Biffs' view on
the subject. Lamb documents the early years of their lives, growing up
and Jesus learning to use his God-given powers. His teens and early
manhood are also documented, as Biff and the son of God travel to China,
India, and beyond so that Jesus can learn how to be the best that he can
be. The last days are also covered in immense, if not depressing detail.

This was the first book I had read by Mr. Moore, but I can assure you
that it will not be the last. It has very strong dialog which kept me
engaged and entertained from start to finish. I found the story both
past and present day exceptionally witty and well-written. The detail
provided throughout the book about everything is impressive but not over
the top, which allows for your imagination to have some fun. I devoured
the book in a matter of days because I can assure you that once you
start reading, it's impossible to put down. Moore easily managed to suck
me in and hook me from about 3 pages into the first chapter. It's rare
that I'm so engaged by a book so quickly but Moore did it with ease.

I'll have to mention that though fantastic, this book is not for
everyone. For one it deals with a lot of Jesus' life story which goes
largely undocumented. If you're the type of person who frowns upon the
possibility of blasphemy, do yourself a favor and avoid this one. If
however you are open-minded and enjoy reading something that borders on
the ridiculous, this one's for you.

It's worth picking up folks, plain and simple. I cannot give enough
accolades to Christopher Moores' ability to make you laugh and cry
within pages of each other. Lamb is a solid read, and should be sought
after by everyone.

10/10
