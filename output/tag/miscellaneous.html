            <p>That is, of course, because after roughly 6 months, I am actually
writing something!</p>
<p>I hope you've found religion, because I'm going to start doing this more
often. What does this mean? This means that Corey is finally getting off
his lazy god-damned-ass and is going to start writing words in sequence
again.</p>
<p>Now if you put these sequenced words together, you will find that they
make sentences. These sentences, when grouped into logical sections
well, they become paragraphs. If I can actually manage to put enough of
these words onto a page, you could actually become entertained by what
may be considered an editorial, a review, or a terrifying essay about
clowns that live within your closet ...</p>

            <p>Alright, so a post at 11:30 pm on the day you say you're going to post
still counts right? Regardless, here we are. My only defense is that I
was no where near a computer for the time required to actually put
something together. I'll make it up to any/everyone that actually reads
this.</p>
<p>Anyways, todays little post is a little bit of a bitch. That is to say
that I am bitching about something that to this day manages to blow my
mind.</p>

<p>Seriously, it's been around longer than we have. We have developed
wheel-drives, tires, break-styles, wiper-blades, anti-freezing,

            <p>The more I try and read what others are saying on the world wide
interweb, the more I realize that there are a lot of people out there
who are a hell of a lot smarter then myself. <a href="http://jarkkolaine.com/" title="Jarkko Laine">Jarkko
Laine</a> is one of those people.
While looking around his site, I found what is deemed a "<a href="http://jarkkolaine.com/2007/07/26/never-work-overtime-again/" title="Mever Wprk Overtime Again">popular
article</a>".
The title alone got me to read it (Never Work Overtime Again) and after
reading it I can honestly say that he nailed it perfectly. Nothing could
be done to improve the statements made therein.</p>
<p>I can honestly attest to what he's saying, seeing as how I have worked
insane amount of overtime at my current place of work. The worst ...</p>

            <p>This is going to sound like an odd article, as I have yet to write
anything on this site remotely reflective or contemplative. I don't know
why, actually but that's just how it's turned out. In any case, I was
talking to Theresa on Sunday when the topic of my friend Norm moving to
Japan. She commented on how she was jealous of those who have "free
lives" or those who can just "up and do it." She also made the comment
that not all of them succeed, to which I responded with "those are the
ones that lack the strength of character to see it out."</p>
