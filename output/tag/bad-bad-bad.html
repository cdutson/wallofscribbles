            <p>I am a 27 (almost 28) year old, white, North American (Canadian,
specifically) male. I have loving parents, dear brothers, friends, my
beautiful wife, and a whole load of awesome experiences under my belt. I
have a job, a roof over my head, loads of electronic gadgets that enrich
my life and keep me thoroughly distracted. Hell I work on them for a
living, making things on the internet do things. It's almost magical.</p>
<p>I am a very lucky man. I'd say blessed, if I had a faith to fall back
upon. That's not to say I'm not spiritual, but if there is a higher
being, I'm pretty sure they've got better things to ...</p>

            <p>Back in the day, I worked at a place that, while educational, was
terrible to work at in a first world sort of way. I wasn't getting paid
my due, the atmosphere wasn't what one would call supportive, and the
management was... well that's where this story comes in. I won't name
the company, though why I'm protecting them is beyond me. Anyone with a
bit of investigative skills can figure out where this was. I'll even
give you a clue: It wasn't a school.</p>
<p>Anyways, I was a developer at a smaller web development company that was
run more through fear and unreasonable expectations than through proper
management savvy. This place also ...</p>

            <p>I'll preface this by saying that since getting my XBox 360, I've been
enjoying it thoroughly. It works fairly well, It's shiny, I can now play
games from my bed, it treats me nicely. I know a lot of people will hate
on me for getting a 360, what with the red ring of death issue, blah
blah blah. I'll say now that the Wii needs elbow room, the PS3 has
absolutely nothing on it that I want to play (that's a lie, Little Big
Planet interests me greatly) and I don't feel like having to repeatedly
upgrade my computer just to play games that almost always come out for a
console. I'm ...</p>

un-check the starting options (Remember me, Remember Password, and Auto

from their registry, and some even had to repair Messenger and its
Sign-In Assistant. Then you had people like me for some reason or
another Microsoft decided to totally cut off from their whole service. I
mean a total cut off. I couldn't access their service, I'd get a 404

            <p>Alright, so a post at 11:30 pm on the day you say you're going to post
still counts right? Regardless, here we are. My only defense is that I
was no where near a computer for the time required to actually put
something together. I'll make it up to any/everyone that actually reads
this.</p>
<p>Anyways, todays little post is a little bit of a bitch. That is to say
that I am bitching about something that to this day manages to blow my
mind.</p>

            <p>So I've been charged with expanding on the functionality of a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/technetmag/issues/2007/01/Wiki/default.aspx" title="Microsoft TechNet">Wiki
Library</a>.
For those not in the know, a Wiki Library is part of SharePoint 2007
(not WSS) and allows for some nifty features such as version viewing,
article linking, and... yeah that's pretty much it. It does all of this
pretty well in and of itself. Woe be upon the person (me) who tries to
crack open this walnut of misery.</p>
<p>As it turns out, customizing a Wiki Library to do anything isn't just
difficult, it's not even a chore. It's a goddamn mission of epically
frustrating scale. Let's start off with some over-all items:</p>
