<p>Now there are certain artists that sound good on albums but come up
short in live shows. There are other artists that rock live performances
like they were born to it, but fail to translate this to their
recordings (Live ones aside, obviously). Then there are artists that do
both exceptionally well. This is where Butch Walker falls. I have had
the undeniable privilege to be literally two feet away from the man as
he performed a live show at the Horseshoe Tavern in Toronto a while
back. Until then I had only heard his albums
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letters_%28album%29" title="Wikipedia: Butch Walker - Letters">Letters</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Is_Me..._Justified_and_Stripped" title="Wikipedia: Butch Walker - This Is Me... Justified And Stripped">This Is Me... Justified and
Stripped</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_of_Self-Centered" title="Wikipedia: Butch Walker - Left of Self-Centered">Left of
Self-Centered</a>)
and was already a big fan.</p>
<p>Then he started singing in that little Tavern. The true test of an
artist really comes down to how close their live and recorded
performances match up. Butch Walker sounds the same, other than changing
it up a little in the live shows just because he can. <a href="http://www.musicane.com/m/dh19872/home" title="Butch Walker - Leavin the Game on Luckie St">Leavin' the Game
on Luckie
Street</a>
is the second live album that I've heard by Mr. Walker and I can happily
say that I am still in love with his work.</p>
<p>The album is actually split up between two discs (two discs for free,
dear Lord) and have drastically different feels. I've decided to talk
about them separately because of this.</p>
<!--adsense-->

<p>Disc one is jumpy. I don't mean in a spazzy sort of way, but in the "get
the fuck up and dance" sort of jumpy. You listen to that first disc and
you just want to get up and dance the hell out of your shoes, socks, or
even your bare feet. This CD has many tracks from the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rise_and_Fall_of_Butch_Walker_and_the_Let%27s-Go-Out-Tonites" title="Wikipedia: Butch Walker - The Rise and Fall of Butch Walker and the Let's-Go-Out-Tonites">Butch/LGOT</a>
album, yet also features some tracks from Marvelous 3 (a band he was
formally a part of). The only slow track on the first half is Don't
Move, so time will fly as you bounce around listening to it. It's solid
and fun, though to be honest I was never as big a fan of the Butch/LGOT
album in comparison to his solo work.</p>
<p>Enter disc two.</p>
<p>Disc two is easily one my favorite cds of all time, regardless of the
fact that it. It features a lot more of his solo work though it also
features tracks from the Butch/LGOT and Marvelous 3 albums. This half of
the album is way more toned down, and features a lot of Butch's piano
workings. As a result there is a string of songs Mixtape to Best Think
You Never Had that all feature Butch at the piano singing. Even after
that there are a couple more tracks that are slower, and if I have to be
honest, a tad depressing. This man does depressing songs in a fantastic
way that don't make you feel sad, but seem to offer a sense of closure
or reflection that I cannot get enough of. This will probably become one
of my staple 'chill' cds, and those are rare on my play list. Only high
rollers make it to that list. What can I say? I'm picky.</p>
<p>Both cds make up the album in a rather Ying/Yang sort of feel, which can
be jarring for someone who is switching between the two of them without
knowing it. They also seem to suffer from a bit of variable audio. What
I mean by this is that in certain parts, the audio is fantastic but
suffers in others, coming in quiet or the singing being drowned out by
other instruments at times. There are also points where he is obviously
swinging to and from the mic, which can get annoying if you're trying to
enjoy the song.</p>
<p>A great album and worth getting. Six dollars is a fantastic price to pay
for any album, and this one exceeds even that. It's worth listening to,
and though not the best album to introduce yourself to his work (I
suggest Letters), for those who already know about him, this is a
fantastic addition to the library.</p>
