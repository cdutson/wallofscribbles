        <p>So how about that schedule of mine eh? I was doing so well too... well
alright not that well but better than I was expecting given that I'm in
school once again.</p>
<p>So what have I been up to that has kept be so busy over the past couple
weeks that would ruin my blog ethic? School (assignments and tests
alike), a side project that went public, homework, weddings and a desire
to finally beat a game that I've owned for far, far too long.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>We'll start with school, because that's something I do 3 days a week.</p>
<p>That's right, you heard me: three whole days. It's amazing that I have
time to do anything at all. Actually to get technically it's more like 2
point something days, since one day starts at 11, and another one starts
at 1 in the afternoon. Given this impressive crunch on time, It's a
shock that I haven't been killed by my own laziness.</p>
<p>Where my in-class schedule fails, my homework kicks in. The first month
was, for all intents and purposes, a joke. I had nothing to do and found
myself very much wanting in time-killing devices. Thankfully as we're
rounding the midterm weeks things have picked up considerably. In the
last 2 weeks I've had roughly seven assignments, two mid-terms, and a
presentation. This week offered two more assignments for tomorrow,
another for Tuesday, and I'm sure I'll have more for Thursday.</p>
<p>Last time I was in college, I spent a maximum of two hours on homework
before declaring it a lost cause (this of course excludes the last
semester where days blurred together in the mad-dash that we created
ourselves).</p>
<p>This time around, I recognize the importance of doing ones homework and
assignments (a novel concept, I know). I've been busting my ass to get
everything done, and it's paying off. I'm pretty sure at this point I'm
running a 90%ish average. I'm going to continue my efforts, because I
don't think I've ever run an average this high…ever? The result of my
working hard is that I have 5-6 hour blocks where I'm hunched over my
laptop at all hours of the day and night. My neck despises me.</p>
<p>Something else that's been eating up my weekend and sleeping hours has
been rapidly producing and updating the design and layout for my friend
Bart's new live project:
<a href="http://www.gamecake.net" title="GameCake: Indie Games Fresh from the Oven">GameCake</a>.</p>
<p>The idea behind
<a href="http://www.gamecake.net" title="GameCake: Indie Games Fresh from the Oven">GameCake</a>
is pretty straight-forward. If you have a game, and no where to host it,
you can upload it to
<a href="http://www.gamecake.net" title="GameCake: Indie Games Fresh from the Oven">GameCake</a>,
describe it, provide screen shots and the like. If you're a fan of
independently-made games, The simple to use archive browsing, ranking
system and overall navigation makes for a simple and enjoyable
game-whore experience.</p>
<p>My role in the whole thing was and is to create, maintain, and update
the design of the website. I'm doing my best to focus on usability and
layout, making things as pain-free (for the users) as possible.
Considering I rigged the entire design and layout up in a record time of
about 14 hours, I'm happy with it. Now that it's gone alpha, we've been
getting good feedback, and I've been improving the design ever since.</p>
<p>Oh, I've had weddings/receptions to go to every other week for the last
two months. Seriously, people need to calm down and not get married so
much. Honestly some of us have things we need to do! In all seriousness
though, the last couple of weddings and receptions I've gone to have
been pretty fab. My one exception to all of this is the excessive
amounts of Country music that I've had to endure. I know it's your
wedding and all, but what do you think the odds that 100+ people are
<strong>all</strong> going to be dire fans of Country.</p>
<p>Finally I've been playing through Earthbound recently, though I've hit a
point where I have to power level, and so I'm taking a break from the
monotony to play another kind of monotony: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_Moon:_Magical_Melody" title="Wikipedia: Harvest Moon: Magical Melody">Harvest
Moon</a>.
I know I've talked about it before somewhere (Wordpress's search is not
all that impressive), but I've been ever so slowly working my way
through this evil game.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I love the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_Moon_(series)" title="Wikipedia: Harvest Moon (series)">Harvest Moon
series</a>,
and have from the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System" title="Wikipedia: SNES">SNES</a>
version. The problem is that the version that I currently have is such a
bitch to beat that it boggles the mind. I would never give this game to
a child, because they would weep at their own inabilities.</p>
<p>The premise of this game is that you have to collect musical notes to
revive the Harvest Goddess. Yeah, really manly this game is. In any
case, you can collect 50 notes, which revives the Harvest Goddess in
under a year (a year is 120 days in game). To get the next 50, you have
to sell your soul to the undead legions of the Abyss. That or you can
bust your ass in vain trying to get them. I'm fairly competent in
Harvest Moon, and I'm only at 75 notes out of the possible 100. I've
clocked more game time with this version of Harvest Moon than I have
most of the games on my shelf.</p>
<p>Insanity.</p>
<p>So there you go, a nice personal post to keep the site a float.</p>
<p>Oh! And Happy Halloween everybody.</p>
