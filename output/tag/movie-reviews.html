            <p>It's actually been a while since I've been to the theaters. The last
time I was there, I saw TRON. We all know how I <a href="/2010/tron-legacy-it-made-me-has-a-sad" title="Wallofscribbles.com - TRON Legacy. It made me has a sad">felt about
that</a>.
Generally I'll watch movies at home rather than pay the anal-rending
prices that the UK movie chains charge their unsuspecting victims.</p>
<p>However, there are a bunch of legitimately interesting movies coming out
right now. So much so that I am willing to go to the movie theaters to
watch them (though I'll admit that this decision is assisted heavily by
the 2 for 1 deal I can get every wednesday).</p>
<p>One such movie that has just come out here in the UK is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Swan_(film)" title="Wikipedia - Black Swan (film)">Black

            <p>So I ended up seeing this movie a bit at the last minute. That is to
say, Theresa told me about it, then told me that she was seeing it with
her friend at a time that allowed little error in me driving 1.5 hours
to get to the theater. I arrived with about 6 minutes to spare, and
though it probably cost me a mint in gas (not to mention the 10 dollar
movie ticket [ damn you indie film support]), I am glad to say that it
was worth every penny</p>

went and saw it with Theresa when It came out in Canada (October 3rd, if
anyone is wondering). We had seen previews for it months ago, and the
idea intregued us both. At that point it fell off the map to anyone who
wasn't actively trying to follow it.</p>
<p>Apparently it was shown at the Cannes film festival to mixed reception.
Reading reviews online does little to ease ones trepidation towards the
film. It seems that Blindness is a movie that has those who love it, and
others that feel that it was "<span class="story_body"><a href="http://www.filmthreat.com/index.php?section=reviews&amp;Id=11233" title="Blindness: reviewed">like looking

            <p>Over the Christmas holidays, Theresa and I went to our local
<a href="http://www.princesscinemas.com/" title="Princess Cincemas">independent movie
theater</a>, and
watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0467406/" title="Juno">Juno</a>. I have to
say that it's easily one of the best films I watched in 2007. It was
sweet, funny, and potent in all the right spots.</p>
<p>The movie Juno is about one Juno MacGuff (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0680983/" title="Ellen Page">Ellen
Page</a>) and Paulie
Bleeker (the ever master of awkward pauses, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0148418/" title="Michael Cera">Michael

joint child-making. The movie takes place during the nine months of
Juno's wonderful adventure through pregnancy, and her interaction with
the adoptive couple Vanessa and Mark Loring (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004950/" title="Jennifer Garner">Jennifer

Smith. The premise of the movie is that Robert Neville (Will Smith) is
the last man alive, after a deadly super-virus lays waste to 90% of the
worlds population. 1% of man kind had a natural immunity to it, and
9%... well that's something else.</p>
<p>A little slow and pointless off the bat, it feels very typical for the
first 20 minutes or so. Once it has been established that, yes, he is
the only guy around, it gets to the good parts. I shouldn't paint it so
negatively, because I Am Legend does a wonderful job of building
tension. I mean, you know shits ...</p>

            <p>Much of the movie revolves around the Vietnam War, and the protests that
went on during the time. All the characters are pulled into differing
sub-cultures and left to their own devices, and are let to play out
their lives with what they've gotten themselves into. It demonstrates
what people are capable of when they feel the need to work for
something. It displays people in their best and worst moments without
much in the ways of compromise, and shows that people aren't perfect nor
do situations always work out glowing. It does glaze over one or two
areas that probably could have had more explaining, but you cannot
realize this during the film and it probably isn ...</p>

watch this movie at about 3 in the morning after Theresa suffered a
horrible coughing fit (she developed a cough while at school). She
decided to put a movie on since she has this amazing habit to fall
asleep to any movie she sets her mind to. I sadly do not have the same
ability. In fact I could go so far as to say that if a movie is being
played, I'll be drawn to it like a moth to the flame, regardless of the
quality of the movie. All it takes is one hook and it's over.</p>

really only get four options: Drink, have sex, go to the mall, or go to
the movies. Well you can mix and match those, but that's basically it.
