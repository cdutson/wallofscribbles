How can I describe this album? I guess it's Indie, but not really. It
really has a bluegrass/pop/alternative blend that really defies clear
classification. Brian O'Neal (way to hard to find his real name, Jesus),
who goes by [Roark](http://www.roarkmusic.com/ "Roark"), does a
fantastic job of delivering heart-felt song after heart-felt song. Each
track sounds like he means every word, which is a rare treat in this day
and age. Though he is technically a solo artist, Brian does have someone
helping him in the studio for these songs. All the songs on the album
tend to offer up some sort of combination of guitar, piano, and drums
(with extras thrown in where needed) and it helps give a unified feel to
the whole CD.

Most of [Break Of
Day](http://www.amazon.com/Break-Day-Roark/dp/B000MG2LKY "Break Of Day")
offers up what I can only describe as a "hopeful vibe". Listening to
this CD makes me happy inside for reasons I cannot accurately
articulate. The light sound and use of the guitar and piano really help
deal some of the uplifting mood, but Brians voice itself seems to embody
something that completes it all. The music and his voice mesh so well
together that it's nothing short of impressive. He knows how to write
music to match him both on a mental and a physical level.

My clear favorite from this CD is easily 'Broken Smile' which is,
admittedly, a rather depressing song. It talks about a girl whos
obviously been hurt deeply. We don't know the whats or whys. All that is
given is the fact that people want to help, but she can't bring herself
to ask for help. It's nearly 6 minutes long, and I love every second of
it. The music itself isn't complex, but it feels totally honest and you
can't help but feel for the girl. It's an amazing track, and sealed the
deal for me.

My only real complaint with the album is that most of the tracks sound
very similar, so if you aren't in love with the album, you'll start
getting annoyed after about 3 tracks. Other than that I can't really
find anything wrong with Break Of Day.

If you're in the mood for something soothing and uplifting, [Break Of
Day](http://www.amazon.com/Break-Day-Roark/dp/B000MG2LKY "Break Of Day")
is totally worth listening to.

7.5/10
