*\*\* Clear Favorites*

"One Cell in the Sea" is rather piano heavy (real piano, not synth...
though it features that too) and is a very calm, relaxed listen. It's
very melancholy and a little on the sad side... Not in that "I'm going
to kill myself the world hates me" sort of way, but more in the "you
just ended a 6 year relationship and moving on" sort of sad. Her voice
projects a stunning amount of clarity and emotion that stands out on
every track.

The album contains a toned-down collection of instruments which I think
was a brilliant move considering how easy it is to throw instruments
into a song to buff it up the sound. Like i mentioned previously, this
album is very toned down and relaxed. That isn't to say it doesn't
convey strong emotion and it has an almost sneaky in its way that it
gets into your head. The funny thing it's not the words that get stuck
in your head (excluding one song that I've been playing the crap out of)
but the melody. I've only had the CD 3 days and I've already caught
myself humming bars from some of the songs on here.

Clear favorites on the track listing have emerged for me, but that isn't
to take away from any of the others. Merely that some tacks touch me
more than others and so they stand out. Specifically "Almost Lover" and
"Ashes and Wine" were more than enough for my purchase to be validated.
The only thing I could add is that the CD is slow. It lacks anything you
could consider to be a "fast track" but I realized that all her music is
basically an extension on her writing (she wrote poetry before music) so
it validates itself.

If you're a fan of female singers, slow and/or melancholy music, Chantal
Kreviazuk, or just good solid music overall, then One Cell in the Sea is
simply a must have. At the very least go have a listen on either their
[MySpace](http://www.myspace.com/afinefrenzy "MySpace/afinefrenzy")or
directly on [their
site](http://www.afinefrenzy.com/news.aspx "A Fine Frenzy") (they have a
music player) and judge for yourself.

8.5/10
