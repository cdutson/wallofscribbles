<p>Apollo opened his eyes. And the sun came out.<br />
 Excerpt from Gods Behaving Badly</p>

<p>As I somewhat gave away in my opener, the story revolves around two
parties. The first is the Greek Pantheon. The main pantheon live in a
crummy townhouse in London that is utterly run-down and otherwise
falling apart. They hate each other, though that's never been a secret.
The second part is the small and simple lives of Alice and Neil. They're
simple cuteness and obvious affection for each other (though hiding it
<em>from</em> each other) makes reading any interaction with them impossible
without smiling.</p>
<p>Did I mention that Aphrodite is a phone-sex operator, and Artemis walks
dogs? I'll admit that these were ...</p>

<p>The whole album is very mellow, and I could almost class it as an
'easy-listening' but it doesn't quite fit. The songs all feature a
slightly slower beat, and there is emphases on strong musical usage. The
singing is put almost as a second thought, much like the way that The
Strokes perform their music. The music comes before the singing, but
they don't conflict. There is heavy usage of the piano, which stands out
as the major player within most of the tracks ...</p>

Quite simply, this is because I spent pretty much every waking hour at

work for 18 hours, got 4 hours of sleep, then went to work the next day

            <h3>What to do when your superior wants everything, in addition to the kitchen sink</h3>
<p>I would love for the simple answer to be to say "No." To stand up for
your project plan and combat the forces of evil that are working
tirelessly to ruin your brain-child. Unfortunately saying no generally
lands you in the dog house with your superior, or fired and replaced
with someone who may or may not be your better.</p>
<p>Many of us know that taking the direct approach will generally land us
in the unemployment line, and so people generally tend to do nothing.
I'm not saying it doesn't work, but I can say that you have to be on
very good terms ...</p>

what I'm talking about here is a crash course: A feature basically
allows you to attach functionality to something in SharePoint. Maybe you
want to add a menu option to the 'Site Actions' menu, or import some
files into libraries. In my case I wanted to attach functionality to a
specific list. I wrote my feature code, and it seemed fine. Deployed and
activated just great.</p>
