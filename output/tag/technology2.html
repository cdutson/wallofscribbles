            <p>So It's been a while since I wrote anything I felt was applicable to
whoring to 9rules, and so when I did go back to their site I had the
shock of finding out that
<a href="http://www.9rules.com/" title="9rules - The best content from the independant web.">9rules</a>
had changed. Drastically changed. At first I didn't even know what I was
looking at. Things had changed so drastically, I didn't know where to
start.</p>
<h3>What happened?</h3>
<p>First of all, they went through a drastic re-design which I am, for the
most part, a fan of. The problem with this is that they changed it all
so much I was utterly lost as to where to go. A better Idea could have
been to have a transitional layout to let ...</p>

and started off by re-imaging the thing to factory settings. This means
I have Windows XP: Home Edition, and not much else. I figured that if
nothing else I could have a laptop with windows on it for when I go
around places. This was not the goal though, as I really want to get
into some python coding. I don't feel like struggling to get python and
Apache running on my main desktop, and even less with fighting with them
to run in Windows.</p>

            <p>Fast forward to my current job. I can assure you that there are a
plethora of examples that I could choose from for the point I will be
making here, but one strikes me as perfect. You see when we developers
started there things were volatile, unstructured, and pretty much a
mess. My now fellow programmers and myself were hired in the wake of a
collection of other developers leaving for one reason or another. We
were also thrust into a project pretty much from the moment we sat in
our chairs.</p>
<p>This was all fine and good, and we build what we thought we were

<p>Leading the users vision can really be taken a couple ways, and I figure
I may as well explain both. The first is literally leading the persons
vision to where you want it to go. This basically means drawing
attention to the focus of the picture. This can be done in a multitude
of ways including leading lines, colours, character actions, the
landscape, etc. There are literally endless combinations to lead the
users vision around a picture and I found some lovely links to explain
it better than me. That's how I roll people ...</p>

            <p>What does it mean to understand design? Good question. I wish I had a
concrete answer, but I don't and so you'll have to take what I say here
with a grain of salt. I would suggest checking

<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/" title="Smashing Magazine">say</a>. From what I
gather (and I have been working hard to gather a lot) understanding
design means understanding not only techniques, but how using those
techniques influence the end-user. Understanding design means knowing
that by changing the lighting of an image, you will change its mood,
even if only by toning the light down 2 Watts. Understanding design is
knowing that you have to convey a message/experience/feeling/essence ...</p>

<p>First thing's first, get your twitchy little fingers on your tools of

using a lot of the Adobe family, I'll be working with them as my
example. Don't be shocked if the program you want has a fully functional
free trial available. All of Adobe has this, and I'm sure they're not
alone.</p>

trails of:</p>
