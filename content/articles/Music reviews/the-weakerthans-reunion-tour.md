I wish I could say I listened to indie music more, and that I was well
versed in it. Truly I wish I could, but the fact of the matter is I am
an outsider to the genr√© and as such, my opinion here is literally just
that: opinion. I'm not saying that all my other music reviews are based
on scientifically music-based fact, but at the very least I know what I
like and dislike and can compare it to something. The closest thing I
can compare [The
Weakerthans'](http://www.theweakerthans.org/ "The Weakerthans") new
album, *[Reunion
Tour](http://www.amazon.com/Reunion-Tour-Weakerthans/dp/B000UGG3M8 "Reunion Tour")*,
would probably be [The Shins](http://www.theshins.com/ "The Shins") or
[Bright Eyes](http://http://www.thisisbrighteyes.com/ "Bright Eyes").
Please don't send me hate mail for being unable to notice the subtle
differences that separate these artists. I don't see them and I don't
really care.

I listened to the album a couple times through, and i sort of realized
that many indie music singers don't sing so much as talk in tone. It's
neat for the first little while, but gets old after 3 or 4 tracks. Would
it kill them to actually sing one or two? You know, just to shake it up
a little? This point alone is enough for me to strip out any tracks I
didn't like and fling the others into nothingness. Even my favorite
tracks are only favorites in true comparison to the other ones. The only
ones I truly liked would be *Civil Twilight Reunion Tour* and
*Tournament of Hearts.* Somewhat depressing really, since I can tell
this is a solid album in some sense.

To try and bring an upswing to this review, I have noticed that if I am
not focused on the album itself, it does make fairly good background
music, so long as you keep it lower then the conversation volume. That
would probably explain why I've heard Civil Twilight in coffee shops.
It's pleasing and simple, and doesn't require the listener pay too much
heed to it. I know that's not much of a compliment, but let me clarify.
What I'm trying to say is that this album is fairly quiet and laid back
and I will admit makes fairly solid background work music. I have found
in the past that this album will come on and I'll be 8 songs in before I
realize what I'm listening to. In that respect it's a great album.

Though I will give this album a rating, it really comes down to a
personal preference. I can't really bash it for being what it is, but I
can state that it was not within my scope of regular listening. Does
that make it a bad album? Hell no, but it's not going to be on my
favorites list.
