            <p>With my moving back to Canada soon at hand, I was forced with the
unfortunate reality that the time I had with my XBox 360 was quickly
drawing to a close. As such, I wanted to make sure I got through a
couple of my unfinished games before getting rid of the lovely thing.
I'm taking the harddrive back home with me, so it's only a temporary
hiatus. That said, one of the titles I opted to complete was Telltale's
<a href="http://www.thewalkingdead.com/" title="The Walking Dead official site">The Walking
Dead</a>.</p>
<p>I really should have thought about that before diving in. Everyone said
it was amazing and moving and sucked you in and sliced bread could learn
a thing or two from it and who ...</p>

            <p>I've played a lot of videogames in my time. Not as many as some, but
I've been playing console games since I was 3 (at least that's as far
back as I can remember). I've played Sega Master System games, I've
played old 386 PC games, I've played my share of SNES, Playstation,
Gamecube, etc. etc. I've played a whole lot of 'em. But one thing I've
never really done is played a collection of games all the way through
their storyline. I was never good enough at Ultima Underworld, my
computer couldn't handle Warcraft 3, Starcraft 2, or the recently
released Diablo III. Hell, even IPs that exist for the ...</p>

            <p>I've been waiting a long time for this.</p>
<p>Pretty much everyone who played the first Portal has been chomping at
the bit for a sequel of sorts to come around. That being said, Portal
was a bit of a sleeper hit (and meme generator). It took a while for it
to become popular. It took even longer for for it to become popular to
release on its own. It did, of course, and I've been the proud owner of

Alive</a>
(the XBox 360 release) for a good while now.</p>
<p>So when I heard about a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002I0J9M0/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=walofscr-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399349&amp;creativeASIN=B002I0J9M0" title="Amazon.com - Portal 2 for XBox 360">Portal

coming out, I became very excited (along with a good portion of the
Internet). What's interesting is Portal ...</p>

            <p>Let us pretend for the sake of this review that it's 2007; people are
getting shot at Virginia Tech, Bob Barker airs his last episode of The
Price is Right, some intense earthquakes happen, and countries are
revoting against their respective leaders. I'd list them here, but
seriously, there were a lot of revolts that year. You could say it
was.... insane? Hah, you totally though I was going to say 'revolting'
but I didn't and I totally got you. You should see the look on your

            <p>It's been a long, long time since I've played any <em>real</em> arcade-style
games. Last time I picked up a controller to play any sort of
side-scrolling, button-bashing, streets-of-fury style game I was a much
younger person. With SNES controller in hand, my friend and I playing
the likes of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_in_time" title="Wikipedia: Turtles In Time">TNMT: Turtles in
Time</a>,

<p>See the problems with my playing these sorts of games are:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm no good at them.</li>
<li>I lack the toned fore-arm muscle of the veteran gamer.</li>
<li>I lacked a console.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well I <a href="/2009/01/06/360-degrees-of-failure/" title="Corey Dutson: 360 Degrees of Failure">now have a
console</a>,
so I have no excuse as to whether I could try to play them or not. Turns
out I still suck at ...</p>
