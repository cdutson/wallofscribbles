        <p>I understand that the tactic they use - which I shall explain- is a
common one, but that in no way makes it right. By doing what they are
doing, they are negating all of the good user experience I had while I
was using their facilities.</p>
<h2>They won't let me leave</h2>
<p>well that's not entirely trueâ€¦</p>
<h2>They are making it impressively inconvenient for me leave</h2>
<p>Brilliant strategy of you've got someone by the credit card, but it's a
horrible move. Try to follow my logic on this one, and feel free to
comment on whether I'm an invalid or not.</p>
<h3>When I signed up, I wasn't pressured</h3>
<p>They showed me around, answered all my questions, and then told me I
could come back anytime if I was interested in signing up. I ended up
signing up that day, as I liked what I saw and liked the staff. It far
surpassed any of the other gyms I had looked at, and I was happy to join
with them.</p>
<p>I signed some papers, wrote off my soul, etc. etc.. Everything was par
for the course.</p>
<h3>I used the facilities, and I liked them</h3>
<p>Things were clean and maintained. The patrons were nice, followed the
rules, and generally got along. I never had a complaint, though I did
overhear one of a lady being upset that another lady was wearing a belly
top of sorts (this was against the dress code.)</p>
<p>get_leader</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that they had a respectable dress code. No
scantily clad women or men. This was a place for working out, not
gawking.</p>
<h3>I got lazy, and stopped going</h3>
<p>Yup, all me. I got lazy, fell out of practice, and eventually stopped
going. I was still paying for the gym though, despite my never going.
That's no ones fault but my own. I was under a contract with them and I
had to wait a while before I could quit.</p>
<h3>I finally got around to quitting, or so I thought</h3>
<p>I walked into the gym that faithful day, and told them that I wanted to
cancel my membership. "No problem," said the helpful desk girl, "Just
mail this paper with your email on it to the head office. They will then
send you an email confirmation and you can cancel."</p>
<p>Wait, what? Mail? You mean that thing with the paper and the stamps and
the envelopes? That thing you do with Santa? Seriously?</p>
<p><strong>Seriously.</strong></p>
<p>Well, that's ridiculous. I'm sure I can just go online or something to
do this. They had a way to sign up for an account, so there should be a
way to cancel it in the same area right?</p>
<p><strong>Wrong.</strong></p>
<p>This is where things went down hill for me. I created an account (which
required a phone call as some of my internal data was missing, causing
the validation to fail), and looked around for a 'Stop Payment' or
'Cancel Account' or something. There was no link to be clicked, no
button to be pressed, no email to be sent. The only way to cancel your
account was to mail in a paper, which you could print from the website,
to their home office on California.</p>
<h3>What's wrong with this picture?</h3>
<p>They did such a good job of nabbing me, of keeping me happy and content,
of making sure my opinion of them was that of 'sunshine from the butt'
proportions. Why would they drop me on my ass when I want to leave? Now
all the good things they did for me are forgotten, and all I can say is
what a bitch it is to cancel my membership.</p>
<h2>Lesson: don't burn bridges</h2>
<p>They have, whether intentionally or not, burned a bridge with me. Not
only do I want to cancel my account with them (I'm working on it, I
promise) but now I want to tell everyone about how much of an ordeal it
is to cancel said account. I'm not going to say how wonderful their
places are, or how considerate their staff may be; I'm going to remember
the freshest experience first: dropped on my ass.</p>
<p>If you're going to try and screw people out of money, fine. I can't stop
you, because that's just how a lot of businesses operate and I'm not one
to comment on that. I'll leave the business commentary to those who
<a href="http://www.ittybiz.com" title="IttyBiz: Small Business Solutions">know what they're talking
about</a>. What
I'm trying to get across is a simple usability exercise: If you make
everything from start to finish as simple and easy as possible, that's
what I will tell people.</p>
<p>Had the gym made it simple to cancel my account, they may have lost out
on my 40 dollars a month. They would have also gained a person who would
spout out their greatness to anyone willing to listen. I liked that gym,
but I will no longer recommend them for this reason.</p>
<p>To summarize: <em>Be nice from start to finish. Even when people are
leaving you, wave them goodbye, don't slam the door on their ass on the
way out. Those people have mouths.</em></p>
<h2>Bonus Lesson: Have a point of contact</h2>
<p>If you visit <a href="http://www.lafitness.com/Pages/ContactUs.aspx" title="mystery gym">their
website</a>,
you'll find that the only way to contact them is via a non-800 phone
number, within set hours. No email, no contact form. What's the point of
a website with online user registration, when you can't even email the
company?</p>
