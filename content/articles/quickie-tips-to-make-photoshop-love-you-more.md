So recently on
[GraphicRiver](http://graphicriver.net/?ref-Corey%20Dutson "GraphicRiver.net"),
a forum thread came up that basically outlined the following:
"***PHOTOSHOP IS SO SLOW WHY GOD WHY?***" In further investigation the
author did admit he had some aging hardware, which really should be
addressed.

For those of us - myself included - that cannot simply afford to drop
good coin on a 9-dimensional quantum quad core extreme dx processor, 5
gigatonne atomic video card, and RAM the equivalent size and girth of
China, we have to make do with what little things we can.

In this case I've come across a selection of little tweaks you can do to
speed up Photoshop. Maybe not by a massive amount, but when you're used
to 10 seconds of lag, taking a couple seconds off that can make a huge
difference. To your sanity, and to the survival of you and those near
by.

And so I've opted to take them from that forum and post the tips here,
complete with screenshots. I apologize in advance as these screens are
done on my mac. The concepts should still be the same though.<!--more-->

Preferences

### Performance Tab

Navigate to Preferences &gt; Performance:

\[singlepic id=676 w=400\]

1.  Up the amount of RAM Photoshop is allows to use. Basically, the more
    the better, but remember that your computer needs some to do
    other things. I suggest somewhere between 70-80% if you can spare
    it.  
    \[singlepic id=680 w=300\]
    </p>

    This is all relative. If you have 8 gigs of RAM 6.4 is a crap-tonne,
    but you still have 1.6 for the rest of your computer, which is
    decent assuming you're not doing anything else crazy. On the flip
    side, if you only have 2 gigs, you donate 1.6 to Photoshop and leave
    400 for the rest of the computer... this will probably make your
    computer divorce you, and you will lose the kids.
2.  If you have a good video card, enable 3D acceleration if
    it’s available. I assume that letting your card do the work will
    help take the strain off of your CPU. If anyone with knowledge
    greater than mine on the subject can comment on this, please do. I'm
    guessing a bit based on common sense reasoning.  
    \[singlepic id=673 w=200\]
3.  Keep your History States low. (This is how many times you can
    hit undo) The lower the better, but be practical. If you usually hit
    “undo” 20 times, then set it to 20. Mine is set to 40 because I'm a
    chronic "nudger" and it helps.
4.  Lower your Cache levels. I don’t know what this does per say, but
    keeping it low seems to help performance. If someone can speak to
    this one as well, that'd be swell.  
    \[singlepic id=674 w=200\]
5.  If you have a spare hard drive sitting around, consider hooking it
    into your rig and allowing photoshop to turn it into a scratch disk.
    That apparently helps a butt-load, though I’ve never had the
    opportunity to do so. Rigging one into my laptop would be a little
    difficult; Apple hates my soldering work so very much.  
    \[singlepic id=678 w=300\]

### Type Tab

Navigate to preferences &gt; Type:

\[singlepic id=677 w=400\]

1.  You can turn off Font Preview, which can help if you have a whole
    mess of fonts. This may or may not become a total pain in the ass to
    those that nitpick fonts, but honestly Photoshop doesn't seem to do
    the greatest job handling the renders. If you have a proper font
    management program, I'd suggest using that anyways to pick out your
    fonts.  
    \[singlepic id=679 w=300\]

Panel... Stuff
--------------

Go to your Layers/ Channels/ Paths panels.

\[singlepic id=675 w=175\]

Turn off the thumbnail previews, that will apparently help out a lot.
I’d suggest doing this if your files start getting larger/ more complex
to help out. Just remember that you will have to have descriptive layer
names or you’ll start getting lost. I can't really live without my
thumbnails, but that's because I am hopelessly visual in nature, and the
ikle pictures help.

No Ickle is not a typo.

1.  To do this, navigate to the panel(s), and under the palette menu, go
    to ‘Palette Options…’  
    \[singlepic id=681 w=250\]
2.  Turn off your thumbnails. The Layers, Channels, and Paths panels all
    have this option.  
    \[singlepic id=682 w=250\]

Having said all this, if your hardware is truly in need of updating,
these fixes will only help you so far.
