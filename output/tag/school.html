            <p>You may, or may not have noticed some changes around here. That is, if
anyone actually reads my blog any more. I'm still working out some of
the kinks in my websites design, but all in all it's coming along quite
well. I've simplified some things; removing search; displaying one item
on the front page; moved the resume and portfolio into the blog (the
resume was its own WordPress install, and the portfolio just... didn't
exist); added a real, honest to God contact page. Things are looking up!</p>

school</a>.
In fact, I even recall writing a

I'm sure I've mentioned it in my
<a href="http://www.twitter.com/Corey%20Dutson" title="Twitter.com: Corey Dutson">twitter</a>
(or at the very least, bitched about it). Well unlike the real world,
College gives you large, void-filled breaks between semesters. This
allows people like me ample time to run out of excuses for things we
should have either done, or been doing during the academic time frame.</p>
<p>In my case this revolves around:</p>

            <p>So where to begin? I've started school, though it's only frosh week so
that doesn't count. I'm liking <a href="http://www.mohawkcollege.ca/homepage.html" title="Mohawk Collge">Mohawk

but the staff at
<a href="http://www.mohawkcollege.ca/homepage.html" title="Mohawk Collge">Mohawk</a>
really seem to give a damn. These teachers actually seem to want to help
me out, especially since I've been working on switching from one stream
to another. The campus (Brantford - Elgin) feels like a high school for
grown ups - I said the same about
<a href="http://www.conestogac.on.ca/" title="Conestoga College">Conestoga</a> - and I've
come to the decision that colleges must look like bigger high schools.
Only Universities can have shiny arty architecture, and nice stuff.</p>

<p>For those who bother keeping up with my site, you will have noticed that
I've recently been <a href="/2008/07/28/i-got-into-school/" title="I Got Into School">accepted to school for graphic
design</a>. Now I never
actually saw any requirement for purchasing a laptop, and I prayed that
I had dodged that financial bullet. Turns out that I did no such thing,
as I was alerted via letter that I would have to purchase a

<p>I was ... unimpressed to say the least. Not only did I not know I had to

roughly 1400 dollars), but I was being told that I had to get a device
that I have little ...</p>

            <p>As I've voiced my opinion over and over (and over), applied my own twist
to things, and finally catching the ear of the designer at my current
job, I've finally got my foot in the door for doing some graphic design
work. Together, the designer and I were really going to blow away the
old designs with a fresh look, new design rules to apply, and a good
application of experience.</p>

<p>Leading the users vision can really be taken a couple ways, and I figure
I may as well explain both. The first is literally leading the persons
vision to where you want it to go. This basically means drawing
attention to the focus of the picture. This can be done in a multitude
of ways including leading lines, colours, character actions, the
landscape, etc. There are literally endless combinations to lead the
users vision around a picture and I found some lovely links to explain
it better than me. That's how I roll people ...</p>

            <p>What does it mean to understand design? Good question. I wish I had a
concrete answer, but I don't and so you'll have to take what I say here
with a grain of salt. I would suggest checking

gather (and I have been working hard to gather a lot) understanding
design means understanding not only techniques, but how using those
techniques influence the end-user. Understanding design means knowing
that by changing the lighting of an image, you will change its mood,
even if only by toning the light down 2 Watts. Understanding design is
knowing that you have to convey a message/experience/feeling/essence ...</p>

<p>First thing's first, get your twitchy little fingers on your tools of

using a lot of the Adobe family, I'll be working with them as my
example. Don't be shocked if the program you want has a fully functional
free trial available. All of Adobe has this, and I'm sure they're not
alone.</p>
