<p>The book is quite literally about what it says it is about: <em>The life
and times of the Wicked Witch of the West</em>. Seriously, that's what it is
about. The book centres around the life of Elphaba, the green-skinned,
sharp-featured and sharp-tongued girl who would one day be the Wicked
Witch of the West, and who would be felled by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Gale" title="Dorothy Gale">young girl from
Kansas</a>. The
book is split into different stages of Elphaba's life and seem more like
snippets rather than entire sections. I had to admit that I was
skeptical about what this book ...</p>

<p>The basic story is that Henry Powell is blamed for the ruining of his
family at the tender age of seven. After this life-altering event, the
family goes down hill. Mom develops a Valium addiction, the older
brother becomes angsty, and dad just distances himself from his
feelings. I'm not giving away plot twists here, merely the story line.
As a result Henry is burdened with the guilt of this, and spends his
life trying to make it ...</p>

            <p>The concept of the book is pretty straight forward: Nameless asshole guy
goes throughout his life, and it's narrated in first person so you get
all of his thoughts as they go. You also get to read about his having
sex, wanting to have sex, jerking off, wishing to jerk off, or some sort
of combination of all the previous activities for about 60% of the book.
This may sound like a pathetic excuse for a novel, but if you take all
the satire out of it, you will realize that guys think about sex on a
near-unhealthy amount. The narrator continues to document his life and
lusts as his relationship falls apart around him and a new one ...</p>

            <p>I finished the book with the same feeling that I've felt after reading
every other new adventure story so far (Winner Takes All, The Clockwise
Man, The Stone Rose, The Art of Destruction, and The Nightmare of Black
Island): Typical. The Clockwise is a possible exception, but not by
much. All these stories, though good, seem like they were rejects for
the show for simply not exhibiting enough strength. They're not bad by
any means and I enjoyed each of them in differing ways. What I am saying
is that I have yet to read a new adventures that can compare to the old
series.</p>

            <p>The first thing to note is that Mr. Brooks varies his writing style to
give each story a life of its own. No two narrators sounded alike, which
I have to admit was an impressive thing to behold. The second, and
easily the more important of the two, things to note is that the stories
for the most part managed to move me.</p>
<p>Considering the entire book is a work of fiction, Brooks managed rather
well to make it feel very real. What's more is that he managed to make
it feel very <em>human</em>. few authors can truly say the same.</p>
<p>An impressive read over all,</p>

            <p>I can honestly say that by reading this book, I actually do feel
somewhat more comfortable about my chances should the dead rise again.
Suffice it to say, Max Brooks takes the idea rather seriously. So
seriously that he has covered everything in this book. Weapons, Survival
gear, locational ratings, terrain types, preventive plans, cleanup
plans, and even a worst case scenario. In all honesty it was in fact, a
honest to God guide on surviving the zombie hordes that come, shambling
and disheveled, to your door.</p>
<p>As a result, the first half of the book (the guide half, which is closer
to three quarters, really) was eventually a bit of a dry read. I'm not
saying this is ...</p>
