about my issue with brain-teasers. I'm sad to say that things have not
improved <em>at all</em>. I still get hung up on them, I still lose sleep over
them, and I still allow them to consume me far too much. It's a
character flaw on my part, and I've learned to live with it. So what do
you think would happen if say, another Professor Layton were to come

            <p>So I ended up seeing this movie a bit at the last minute. That is to
say, Theresa told me about it, then told me that she was seeing it with
her friend at a time that allowed little error in me driving 1.5 hours
to get to the theater. I arrived with about 6 minutes to spare, and
though it probably cost me a mint in gas (not to mention the 10 dollar
movie ticket [ damn you indie film support]), I am glad to say that it
was worth every penny</p>

            <p>It's been a long, long time since I've played any <em>real</em> arcade-style
games. Last time I picked up a controller to play any sort of
side-scrolling, button-bashing, streets-of-fury style game I was a much

<ul>
<li>I'm no good at them.</li>
<li>I lack the toned fore-arm muscle of the veteran gamer.</li>
<li>I lacked a console.</li>

9%... well that's something else.</p>
