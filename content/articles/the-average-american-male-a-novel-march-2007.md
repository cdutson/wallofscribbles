The concept of the book is pretty straight forward: Nameless asshole guy
goes throughout his life, and it's narrated in first person so you get
all of his thoughts as they go. You also get to read about his having
sex, wanting to have sex, jerking off, wishing to jerk off, or some sort
of combination of all the previous activities for about 60% of the book.
This may sound like a pathetic excuse for a novel, but if you take all
the satire out of it, you will realize that guys think about sex on a
near-unhealthy amount. The narrator continues to document his life and
lusts as his relationship falls apart around him and a new one forms.

Now all the smut aside, if you look past the sex, lust, jackassery and
hyper-abused stereotypes, you will see that this book actually does
offer some honest to God truths about how guys think and function. Is it
classy? no. Does this book describe every guy to some extent? Possibly.
Is there true insight in the book if you are willing to read it in an
unbiased fashion? Yes. It documents (in a rather outlandish way,
admittedly) that guys fear that every woman could turn into their
mother. It documents that guys think about sex on a nigh constant basis.
It documents that guys like to masturbate (the book does take it to a
*bit* of an extreme I admit). Hell it even documents the classic
"ex-gone-crazy" scenario. I know that sounds like an asshole thing to
say, but trust me when I say that girls can be insane without being
insane.

It's dirty, it's rough, it's disgusting, it uses horrible stereotypes,
and is rather condescending to both genders. It was also a very
interesting read when you got past all of the smut.

6.5/10
