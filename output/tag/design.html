Tolkien by grade 4. I have a book shelf that I bought because my
original one was two books deep on every shelf. I've become a huge fan

anyone actually reads my blog any more. I'm still working out some of
the kinks in my websites design, but all in all it's coming along quite
well. I've simplified some things; removing search; displaying one item
on the front page; moved the resume and portfolio into the blog (the
resume was its own WordPress install, and the portfolio just... didn't
exist); added a real, honest to God contact page. Things are looking up!</p>

school</a>.
In fact, I even recall writing a

I'm sure I've mentioned it in my
<a href="http://www.twitter.com/Corey%20Dutson" title="Twitter.com: Corey Dutson">twitter</a>
(or at the very least, bitched about it). Well unlike the real world,
College gives you large, void-filled breaks between semesters. This
allows people like me ample time to run out of excuses for things we
should have either done, or been doing during the academic time frame.</p>

design, which I've dubbed "blocks."</p>
<p>As for some technical things, I made this design using a grid, 980 to be
precise. the design itself is actually, 940 pixels wide, though that's
because my fireworks file has a 20 pixel gutter on the sides, which you
can't really notice in this design.</p>
<p>I only use one font throughout the entire site (Arial). This is usually
a bit of a no-no but I went with it, and made sure that all my headings
were differentiated from the content. I also made sure my line-spacing
was tall enough so that the body text didn't become hard ...</p>

            <p>So It's been a while since I wrote anything I felt was applicable to
whoring to 9rules, and so when I did go back to their site I had the
shock of finding out that
<a href="http://www.9rules.com/" title="9rules - The best content from the independant web.">9rules</a>
had changed. Drastically changed. At first I didn't even know what I was
looking at. Things had changed so drastically, I didn't know where to
start.</p>
<h3>What happened?</h3>
<p>First of all, they went through a drastic re-design which I am, for the
most part, a fan of. The problem with this is that they changed it all
so much I was utterly lost as to where to go. A better Idea could have
been to have a transitional layout to let ...</p>

<p>This is pretty straightforward people. <em>Know when you need to deliver</em>
things by (milestones, project builds, documents, etc) and make sure
they're delivered by that date/time. When things start slipping from the
timeline, then it just compounds as one section runs into another.
Believe me when I say that there is only so much overlap you can
orchestrate before something breaks. Think Jenga.</p>
<p>On that same note, make sure that your time requirements are accurate. I
cannot stress that enough. If you think something should only take you
an hour, give yourself 2. If you end up ahead of schedule, great! You've

your project plan and combat the forces of evil that are working
tirelessly to ruin your brain-child. Unfortunately saying no generally
lands you in the dog house with your superior, or fired and replaced
with someone who may or may not be your better.</p>
<p>Many of us know that taking the direct approach will generally land us
in the unemployment line, and so people generally tend to do nothing.
