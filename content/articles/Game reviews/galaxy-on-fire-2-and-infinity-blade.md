Look at that title. I mean really *soak it in*. I challenge anyone to
come up with a title nerdier than that without the use of quantum
physics. I mean it's two games; one from the sci-fi space shooter genre;
the other from the fantasy rpg hack 'n slash genre. If that title were a
little kid, even I would want to pick on him. I mean seriously, he
*deserves* it. Look at him!

Theresa and I bought an iPad a while ago. A completely impulse-based
purchase that was tinged with a bit of buyers remorse about 20 minutes
later. Not that I'm hating on it or anything, it's a nice little
tablet... thing. I regret mostly how goddamned expensive the little
bastards are.

To get my moneys-worth out of the thing, I've been on a perpetual quest
to find games on it that I genuinely enjoy. Not in a '5 minute quickie'
sort of way, but rather in a 'oh goddamnit what happened to the last
hour of my life?' sort of way. It's been slim pickings, let me tell you.
Other than [Battle for
Wesnoth](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/battle-for-wesnoth/id340691963?mt=8 "iTunes - Battle for Wesboth")
and [Chaos
Rings](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chaos-rings/id365678365?mt=8 "itunes - Chaos Rings"),
there hasn't really been much out there that I've managed to find.

Then I cam across two very good games very close together. The result is
that my sleep schedule *despises* me. As an added bonus, both games can
be played on iPhone 3GS/ iPhone 4s, so you can miss your tube stops like
me as well!

Today you are in for a treat. I'm not going to review one, but two
games! Consider this your Christmas present. Hey money is tight. Wh--
shutup! The games were really cheap! Your card is in the mail, honest!
Don't look at me like that. You know I love you, right baby?

Game the first: Galaxy on Fire 2
--------------------------------

![Galaxy on Fire 2

Yeah somehow Galaxy on Fire 1 totally slipped by me. Can't imagine how
that could happen with an app store that has a bazillion friggin' games
in it. From what I've played of the first one though, It's pretty safe
to say that you can just skip right to [number
2](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/galaxy-on-fire-2/id397127539?mt=8 "itunes - Galaxy on Fire 2"),
which is far nicer in graphics, story, gameplay, and pretty much
everything else.

### Storyline

You play as super merc Keith T. Maxwell (badass name, am I right?) who
through some convenient plot devices, ends up 35 years in the future,
and across the universe. He quickly finds his legs, and starts making a
life for himself in the reasonable but not that far off future. He
doesn't really care about going home, which seems a bit sad to me. You
quickly find out that a mysterious race call *the Void* are poaching
freighter cargo, and no one can stop them because they use wormhole
technology to just show up.

At this point everything in the story pretty much revolves around you
stopping them from being assholes. I haven't finished the game yet, but
unless the writers are gonna go all Shyamalan on me, I can't foresee the
story deviating too heavily from this.

### Gameplay

The game has a very Wing Commander meets Freelancer vibe going on, and
that's a good thing. There are the main missions to complete, which
usually involve going somewhere far away from you, getting shot at by
every enemy you run into, and collecting stuff. While this is pretty
boring, there are a slew of side-things to do.

For start, the galaxy is massive. They boast 100 or so planets, but I
think that's pushing it a bit. I'd place it more around 70 - 80, but
that's still a lot of places to visit. There is a wide collection of
ships to upgrade to; weapons that you can buy, salvage, or create; goods
that can be bought and sold for differing market prices; bounty,
collection, betting, escort, rescue, and interception missions you can
take on; blueprints to build; ores you can mine; and achievements to
gain. There are a lot of game hours in this game if you choose to
deviate from the main story.

Flight uses a screen-based joystick that takes a little getting used to.
Alternately, you can use the accelerometer if you want everyone around
you to think you're retarded. There is an auto-fire button which is a
mixed blessing due to the less-than-amazing targeting system built into
the game. There's no way to 'lock' your target, so when you are shooting
homing weaponry at them, and then a neutral flys in front of your target
for too long, you will lock onto them, beat the hell out of them, and
then *everyone hates you*.

This frustration is compounded by the fact that when you show up in an
orbit and there are pirates messing about, as soon as you get within
range of them they will start shooting at you. It doesn't matter if
someone else is shooting at them; it doesn't matter if they were busy
wailing on someone else; the second you show up, like moths to the fire,
they try and mess up your grill. This isn't so bad at the start of the
game, when pirates come in 2s. At my point in the game, there are
normally 6 pirates, they're strong, and they're grouped close together.
Oh and they're right by my jump in point. This makes for some panic-y
flights. If they happen to be near your fly in point, you start getting
shot before your can control your ship, and you *will* take damage.

In their recent update, they added some basic dodge maneuvers while in
flight. This helps a little bit when you are getting tailed by 1 or more
ships when all you want to do is dock at the fucking station. Other than
that, it's a bit disorienting.

The writing isn't stunning, nor is the voice acting. Now I'm not saying
that either are bad in this game, because they're not. They're not
particularly good though. The voice acting is mainly held back by the
writing, and the writing is trying  so hard for you to like it, but it's
held back more or less by the unimaginative missions. I tend to read
faster than the voice actors, and then just skip the text. Again, not
because the acting is bad, but because it's unoriginal.

### Overall

Despite the in-flight issues that I suffer while playing this game, it
is overall a pretty good game. The game mechanics and heaps of extras
more than make up for the games other short-comings, and it's a lot of
fun to play on the ipad. I've only played the iPhone version a bit, but
from what I've seen, they did an excellent job of translating the
controls and the menus to fit the smaller screen-size.

Game B: Infinity Blade
----------------------

![](http://wallofscribbles.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/infinity-blade.jpg "infinity blade")
Just gonna throw this out here, but that '[Infinity
Blade](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/infinity-blade/id387428400?mt=8 "iTunes - Infinity Blade")'
is way more literal than you think when you first get the game. This
game suffers from what I like to call 'too lazy to write a goddamned
ending' syndrome. It's fun, but goddamnit guys, I like my sense
of accomplishment when I actually beat a goddamned game. Don't screw
with people like that!

### Storyline

The storyline... such that it is, goes like this: Your dad seeks revenge
on some guy called The Godless or the God King or... something. He gets
a breakfast full of sword-in-the-gut, and this ties your bloodline into
attempting the same quest of vengeance  generation after generation
after generation. That's it. That's the story. I could spoil the ending,
but considering how fast it is to get there, I won't bother.

### Gameplay

The basic concept of this game is that if you die, your son comes to
finish what you started. and if your son dies, your grandson comes to
clean up after you to, etc etc. You get all the equipment and stats and
level etc as your previous incarnation, and the enemies get stronger to
compensate. This'd be really boring really quick if the graphics weren't
bloody amazing. I will give them credit though, it's a unique way to
handle the game over system without the player utterly losing.

Now if you downloaded the [Epic
Citadel](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/epic-citadel/id388888815?mt=8 "iTunes - Epic Citadel")
app a while back, your mind was probably a bit blown. The graphics in
that game were are so utterly off the hook that you really have to think
hard to remember that it's playing on a mobile device (or an iPad, in my
case). Seriously, the graphics in Epic Citadel are mind-boggling. The
reason I bring this up is because Epic Citadel was a tech demo for the
engine that Infinity Blade is based off of. You don't get to free-roam,
but Jesus, Mary, and Joseph is this game pretty. It's an engineering
marvel to say the least, and it's a pleasure to look at, even when
you're on your 5th timeline.

The fighting in this game is fun, original, and worth the purchase of
the game simply to experience. You sword fight. You can dodge attacks,
block them with your shield, or if you can match your opponents' angle
you can parry their attacks. After you go through a sequence of dodging,
blocking, or parrying you get your chance to wail on them with either a
hack 'n slack back and forth attack, or with some magic, which requires
you to draw some sort of pegan symbol on the screen. Lots of fun, and
can get challenging if you're not paying attention.

P.S. Parrying is really, really difficult. The game is pretty picky
about certain angles and timing. You've been warned.

So the idea of this game is that when you get to the end boss, either
you beat his ass or he beats yours. Regardless of the outcome, your
ancestor will come seeking revenge. This is where the 'too lazy to write
a goddamned ending' syndrome kicks in. I mean it might take you a couple
bloodlines to beat the end boss (I was level 12 when I managed it), but
even after you've beaten him. you just get a whack of experience and
then you go onto the next bloodline. There is no end to the game. At
all. At least none that I've found. Oh, and while you're fighting him,
there is a point where you can choose to fight or join the God King
Emperor guy. Don't bother doing that other than to get a bit of story.
Know why? Because the game will roll credits and start you RIGHT BACK
WHERE YOU WERE BEFORE THE FIGHT. Meaning you have to do the whole fight
*again*.

The other real pain with Infinity blade is that there's not that much
variation. Sure you can put on different equipment and such, but new
parts of the castle don't open up to you. No new paths are revealed as
you level up. I  have played through 5 bloodlines now, and I know
exactly where all the chests are, where the normal money bag spots are,
where all the enemies are, etc. I could automate all of the walking
through the 'dungeon' (if that's what you want to call it).

The sound also bugs me a bit. Not the combat sounds so much, but the
music bites are small and don't loop well, and the enemy 'voices' are
annoying as a five  year-old with a caffeine addiction.

### Overall

The game looks stunning. The actual fighting is lots of challenging fun.
Everything in-between let me down. It's literally a game about grinding.
It is 'Grinding: The Game' I still play it in small fits now (it's a
great way to pass time on the bus or train) but after blazing through to
the 'end' of the game, my interest for the game has dropped a couple
pegs.  Apparently an upcoming update will have new areas to explore, P2P
combat, new enemies, etc. When that happens, we'll see if my opinion
changes. Until then, it's a game with great potential that just sort of
missed the mark a bit.
