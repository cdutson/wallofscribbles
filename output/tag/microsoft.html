            <p>I'll preface this by saying that since getting my XBox 360, I've been
enjoying it thoroughly. It works fairly well, It's shiny, I can now play
games from my bed, it treats me nicely. I know a lot of people will hate
on me for getting a 360, what with the red ring of death issue, blah
blah blah. I'll say now that the Wii needs elbow room, the PS3 has
absolutely nothing on it that I want to play (that's a lie, Little Big
Planet interests me greatly) and I don't feel like having to repeatedly
upgrade my computer just to play games that almost always come out for a
console. I'm ...</p>

            <p>My feature code was throwing an error today. For those who don't know
what I'm talking about here is a crash course: A feature basically
allows you to attach functionality to something in SharePoint. Maybe you
want to add a menu option to the 'Site Actions' menu, or import some
files into libraries. In my case I wanted to attach functionality to a
specific list. I wrote my feature code, and it seemed fine. Deployed and
activated just great.</p>
<p>Then I tried to create a Custom List. I had event receivers attached to
custom lists (ListTemplateID=100 for those who care) and i got this:</p>
<p><em>Cannot insert the value NULL into column 'Name', table
'[somesharepointcontentdatabase].dbo.EventReceivers';<br />
column ...</em></p>

            <p>I'm bringing this up from an exceptionally small thing I noticed while
at work today. As I have previously stated, I work with
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepointserver/FX100492001033.aspx" title="Microsoft SharePoint 2007">SharePoint</a>.
Much of the time I am branding it (though not in my current project!)
and so I have a rather intimate and abusive relationship with the
program. I find myself constantly finding weird styling quirks put into
the environment that prove that SharePoint was built by a large group of
people.</p>
<p>There are many instances within SharePoint - and I'm sure within
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepointtechnology/FX100503841033.aspx" title="Microsoft WSS 3,0">WSS</a>
as well - where certain styles that should be consistent end up being
done completely different ways. I wish I had a screen shot as an
example, but you'll have to use ...</p>

from their registry, and some even had to repair Messenger and its

and started off by re-imaging the thing to factory settings. This means
I have Windows XP: Home Edition, and not much else. I figured that if
nothing else I could have a laptop with windows on it for when I go
around places. This was not the goal though, as I really want to get
into some python coding. I don't feel like struggling to get python and
Apache running on my main desktop, and even less with fighting with them
to run in Windows.</p>

            <p>So I've been charged with expanding on the functionality of a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/technetmag/issues/2007/01/Wiki/default.aspx" title="Microsoft TechNet">Wiki
Library</a>.
For those not in the know, a Wiki Library is part of SharePoint 2007
(not WSS) and allows for some nifty features such as version viewing,
article linking, and... yeah that's pretty much it. It does all of this
pretty well in and of itself. Woe be upon the person (me) who tries to
crack open this walnut of misery.</p>
<p>As it turns out, customizing a Wiki Library to do anything isn't just
difficult, it's not even a chore. It's a goddamn mission of epically
frustrating scale. Let's start off with some over-all items:</p>

            <p>Hello one and all, I hope you've been keeping well! I've been pretty
mentally exhausted all week but I still managed to keep the content
rolling out. I've even managed to start a new book (already 160 pages
in) and actually do a bit of writing (another chapter 'done') and
generally getting some tasks out of the way. It's been a productive, but
exhausting week. So much trekking around, it's insane.</p>
<p>Highlights of the week include:</p>
<p><strong>I hate InfoPath:</strong><br />
I know the idea behind the program is sound, and I'm impressed with the
level of integration that Microsoft has managed to achieve with
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepointserver/FX100492001033.aspx" title="Microsoft SharePoint 2007">SharePoint

and
