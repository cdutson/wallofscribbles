 Excerpt from Everything Must Go</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The basic story is that Henry Powell is blamed for the ruining of his
family at the tender age of seven. After this life-altering event, the
family goes down hill. Mom develops a Valium addiction, the older
brother becomes angsty, and dad just distances himself from his
feelings. I'm not giving away plot twists here, merely the story line.
As a result Henry is burdened with the guilt of this, and spends his
life trying to make it up to his parents. It's sort of sad to see the
pathetic progression of his life, or a lack thereof.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/f/elizabeth-flock/" title="Everything Must Go"><em>Everything Must
Go</em></a>
is an easy read and doesn't provide much strain on the brain. This is
sadly a double-edged comment. What that means is that though easy to
read, it is adversely not that intriguing in its plot line. I got the
gist of it about 150 pages in. It's like the bizzaro Rudy. It's Rudy if
he didn't get into Notre Dame. All the sappy depression, but no upswing
at the end. It sort of just levels out on itself. Say you started at a
happy scale of 5. the book brings you down to negative ten, then manages
to crawl back up to about a zero. The ending left me somewhat deflated,
though that comes down to personal opinion.</p>
<p>I will admit its a sadly detailed look into the life of those who don't
quite make it. Those people that don't make it out there and do
something with their lives. Not even anything extraordinary, but even
those who go out and blend into the median. Henry is a character that
sits outside the bell curve, cursing it for its comfortableness and at
times holstering his guilt as a badge of honour. It's a story about love
and duty, no matter how misplaced either must be. I appreciated that
though depressing, Henry stands out as a man of his word above all else.
He is a sad and simple man, but he is honest and truthful... even if
that makes him sound like a psycho throughout some of the book.</p>

also managed to incur in me one of the longest "cringe moments" of my
life. In my Social Psych class, we were taught that men and women
respond differently to the same situation. For instance when someone is
doing a speech, and failing horribly at it, men will cringe and look
away. Women tend to lean in and pay more attention, trying to offer
silent support. It was this look-away-and-cringe effect that flowed
within me for about a third of the book, though at differing times. I
can't explain why, but anyone who reads this one through will
understand.</p>
<p>It wasn't a bad book, though I think I may have missed the point. I am
also wary of any book that actually comes with "discussion questions" in
the back.</p>
