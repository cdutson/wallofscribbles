            <p>So I've been doing a lot of javascript development at work recently.
I've basically created a lot of our reusable javascript 'plugins' to
cover the common requirements of the work that we do. In many cases,
this resides mostly (but not entirely) in online annual-report creation.</p>
<p>Anyone that's in the business will know that there are some common
functional elements that you end up having to build with javascript:
accordions, tabs, faders, sliders, lightboxes, filters, etc. Many of
these items can bleed over into non-report sites, such as intranets or
even public-facing sites.</p>

<p>Now some of those are fairly straight forward: an accordion is just a
simple animate of a content section, repeat per title; tabs? Same ...</p></!--more-->

            <p>The <a href="http://icanhascheezburger.com/" title="Lolcats!">lolcat</a> title reference
aside, I have actually started producing WordPress plugins for myself.
I've always wanted to make them, and so a while back I set aside a day
(well two, once I got the hang of it) and learned. Granted I've still
got a ways to go, but at least I've finally got my foot in the door with
it all. The trick is to make sure to create things that are actually
useful so that people will actually use them.</p>
<p>So as a result of my tooling around with WordPress, I've created two
plugins for people to use.</p>

            <p>So who out there uses Wordpress? I've been told it's <a href="http://publisherblog.automattic.com/2008/01/23/wordpress-most-popular-cms-in-technoratis-top-100/" title="Wordpress: Most popular CMS">somewhat
popular</a>.</p>
<p>I myself am a fan despite it's <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001105.html" title="Coding Horror: Behold Wordpress, destroyer of CPUs">assault on the CPU and
database</a>.
It's fast, it's simple, and so long as your website isn't gaining huge
traffic (or you're paying peanuts for CPU usage and storage) than it's a
great selection. It's fairly customizable, <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/" title="Wordress: Extend">has a huge support and user
base</a>, and it's just
damned easy to use. I've been slowly getting more and more into
customizing and extending what Wordpress can do out of the box.There's
more in the code than people think.</p>

            <p>Fast forward to my current job. I can assure you that there are a
plethora of examples that I could choose from for the point I will be
making here, but one strikes me as perfect. You see when we developers
started there things were volatile, unstructured, and pretty much a
mess. My now fellow programmers and myself were hired in the wake of a
collection of other developers leaving for one reason or another. We
were also thrust into a project pretty much from the moment we sat in
our chairs.</p>
<p>This was all fine and good, and we build what we thought we were
<em>supposed</em> to build. Three days before we showed it to the client, we

            <p>So I've been charged with expanding on the functionality of a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/technetmag/issues/2007/01/Wiki/default.aspx" title="Microsoft TechNet">Wiki
Library</a>.
For those not in the know, a Wiki Library is part of SharePoint 2007
(not WSS) and allows for some nifty features such as version viewing,
article linking, and... yeah that's pretty much it. It does all of this
pretty well in and of itself. Woe be upon the person (me) who tries to
crack open this walnut of misery.</p>
<p>As it turns out, customizing a Wiki Library to do anything isn't just
difficult, it's not even a chore. It's a goddamn mission of epically
frustrating scale. Let's start off with some over-all items:</p>
