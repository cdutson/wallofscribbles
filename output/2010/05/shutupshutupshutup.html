        <p>Yup.</p>
<p>So yeah I'll admit that it's been a while since I've updated (roughly
two months for those sharpening their pitchforks) and I could say that I
was super busy what with my end of year projects totally consumed my
life, or that I was a tad busy moving countries, or that I haven't had
real internet access since being here, or that I was just a lazy prat
who found loads of other excuses to avoid writing something.</p>
<p>You know all of those things are true, so let's just move on, yes?</p>
<p>First off: The Photoshop/Photography assignment what consumed my soul.
I, along with my group member created a calendar featuring some of
the T-shirts we own (and in some cases bought specifically for). It was
a gruelling process that involved a lot of photo taking, a lot of photo
fixing, and an ungodly amount of channel masking and photoshop trickery.
Hell I learned how to do things I didn't know you could think of doing
in Photoshop. I've published the calendar up on Flickr, so you can go
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/corey_dutson/sets/72157623954233379/" title="Flickr: Corey Dutson - Photoshop Calendar">check that
out</a>,
if you want. I've also pushed up a lot of the raws and rejects up, which
you can <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/corey_dutson/sets/72157623338615291/" title="Flickr: Corey Dutson - Photography Class - Calendar">find
here</a>,
if you want.</p>
<p>I had a lot of fun doing this project, even though it consumed way way
way too much of my time (somewhere in the 50-70 hour mark). We got to
have complete creative freedom with the project, which was one of the
few times we really got that opportunity in school. There were some
technical requirements that needed fulfilling to get the marks, but
other than that we were free to do whatever we wanted with it. I have
yet to send anything to
<a href="http://www.threadless.com" title="Threadless.com">Threadless</a> themselves, not
that they would really want much to do with it.</p>
<p>Item number two: I've moved.</p>
<p>More specifically, I've moved countries. I am now a fresh-faced member
of the British Union. Even more specifically, I am now living with
Theresa, the long-time girlfriend in London, England.</p>
<p>This is, of course, not my first time being here. I've been a couple
times before, and this shouldn't come as a shock to the negative 15 of
you that still have my blog on your RSS feeder slowly collecting dust. I
have <a href="http://www.wallofscribbles.com/2010/02/15/five-months-lazy-pants/" title="Wallofscribbles.com - Five Months Lazy Pants">mentioned this
event</a>
before, so this isn't shocking news. If it is, you're probably a new
reader, and I refuse to apologize to you for anything you may or have
already read on this site.</p>
<p>Getting back on topic, as I sit here eating a candy necklace in the
middle of the afternoon, I cannot help but think that I have refused to
do any of this the 'easy way.' That is to say that instead of moving
into my own place back in Canada; moving in with a girlfriend over
there; or basically doing ANY of the things I'm doing now in a safer
environment; I just up and do it all overseas.</p>
<p>No problem, right? Well actually, yeah, pretty much. I'm not saying it
was a cake walk: there was the whole passport incident back in January
that I'll try to write about one day, the difficulties selling my car,
the not having anyone to meet me at the airport because the tube was
stopped, the not actually having a place to live yet thing, the getting
kicked out of the place I WAS staying at thing, the car accident thing,
the not having a job to arrive to thing, or the lack of Internet thing.
There have been some unique challenges, but overall it's worked out
alright.</p>
<p>I have a new place with Theresa, the Landlord is super great, the flat
is fantastic, and we're getting Internet sometime today (fingers
crossed). I'm working on the job thing, so that's going well.</p>
<p>This leads me to item c: I have a new blog! well sort of. I've developed
a Tumblr account for my day to day things that I see/do/experience in
London and the rest of the EU. You can keep tabs on in at
<a href="http://dutsoninlondon.tumblr.com/">http://dutsoninlondon.tumblr.com/</a>. I'm hoping for it to be mostly a
photo/video posting area, but I'll post occasional sound bites, quotes,
etc. that come to mind there.</p>
<p>The reason for my doing this is to create a separation between my work
and my travels. No one would want to see all those silly things posted
up on here, and I wouldn't write these long-winded grammatical wonders
over there. Is your head still attached to your shoulders? Or did I just
blow it away with my fantastic wordsmithing? I'm like a level 28 Word
Smith. Don't fuck with that. I have a hammer.</p>
<p>I should probably stop eating this candy necklace soon.</p>
<p>Item the fourth: I have an iPhone now. This has changed the way I ride
subways and how I poop forever. Oh look the necklace is finished. That's
probably for the best. Anyways, you can be sure that within the next
little while, I shall be gushing over the apps that I have actually
found useful.</p>
<p>Last item: We're still waiting on a fridge and washing machine to be
delivered. Argos is dragging their ass in actually getting the washing
machine so they won't deliver the fridge. Apparently having to wait two
weeks is quite alright to get a goddamned fridge. We make due by buying
fresh every dinner, but seriously you can only have toast so many days
for breakfast before that knife on the corner starts looking like it
needs a friend. Or maybe it's you who needs the friend.</p>
<p>Anywho, that's me pretty much up to date. Believe it or not I actually
have a couple of posts lined up for the next little while. Yes, that's
right, pick that jaw up off the floor. I said pick it up, damn you.</p>
<p>I can wait all day.</p>
<p>Better. Yes I actually have a couple posts, some of which are useful,
some of which are awesome. Just to give you an idea, if I had drawn a
venn diagram showing which are useful and which are awesome, you would
see nothing but a circle. Have a think on that.</p>

<p>P.P.S. I am planning a blog re-design in the nearish future. I'm very
not happy</p>
