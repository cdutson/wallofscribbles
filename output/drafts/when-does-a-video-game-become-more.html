        <p>You know, I've played may games in my short(ish) time here on Earth. In
my youth, my household had a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sega-Master-System-Console/dp/B001JB159O/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372935564&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=sega+master+system" title="Amazon - Sega Master System">Sega Master
System</a>
and a beast of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80386" title="Wikipedia - 386 processors">386
computer</a>
(with eight whole MB of RAM). I have been playing video games literally
since before I could tie my shoes,  see over counter tops, or stay up
past 7 PM. When I got older, I purchased my first console, an original
PlayStation, which I played until the day it stopped spinning discs. I
invested my own time and money into getting more games into my grubby
little hands. I got my first job as a direct requirement of this.</p>
<p>It's safe to say I'm a fan of video games.</p>
<p>I've played all sorts, from RPGs to sports; from puzzles to card; from
strategy to the just plain weird. I'm willing to give most games a go,
even though I may not have any particular preference for that genre. But
why? what makes games so interesting to me? Why do I choose to invest so
much time when I could be doing other things like sports or world
domination scheming?</p>
<!--more-->

<p>And it's not fair to say that I enjoy all games equally, as that most
assuredly is not the case. I've picked up games and loathed them, many
games in fact. Beyond that, there are many games I pick up, play, and
then put away, never to be thought of again. These are not bad games per
se, but they didn't hook me, they didn't draw me in. To me, these two
categories of video games are exactly that: video games. They're
enjoyable (or not), they have rules (or a lack there of), and they
occupy my time (unless they are thrown out the window in rage or
disgust). They can be very good games, and I do have many of these on my
phone for example; ready and willing for a quick pick-up and play
session. They are challenging, or have great replay value, or have a
reward mechanism that works for me. They're all good games, but that's
it: they're just <em>good.</em></p>
<p>So then we now come to my third category; the games I remember, cherish,
discuss well after I've played them. What makes it into my personal
third category? Like I said, I've played many, many games in my time,
and I've reviewed a selection of them
<a href="http://wallofscribbles.com/2009/front-mission-square-enix/" title="Wall of Scribbles - Front Mission Review">on</a>
<a href="http://wallofscribbles.com/2009/my-world-my-way/" title="Wall of Scribbles - My World, My Way Review">this</a> <a href="http://wallofscribbles.com/2011/borderlands/" title="Wall of Scribbles - Borderlands Review">very</a> <a href="http://wallofscribbles.com/2011/stacking-double-fine-2011/" title="Wall of Scribbles - Stacking Review">website</a>.
Very few games end up landing my personal third category, and it's a
sliding scale therein. However one of the biggest over-arching themes
with all of my favourites boils down to one thing: <strong><em>story</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Because for me at least, <strong><em>story</em></strong> breeds <strong><em>immersion</em></strong>,
<strong><em>immersion</em></strong> summons <strong><em>emotion</em></strong>, and <strong><em>emotion</em></strong> brings out
<strong><em>all the feels.</em></strong></p>
<h2>A Story about stories</h2>
<p>I was not a popular child growing up. I'll talk about that on a
different day, but for now let's simply say that I was typically
unpopular. With few friends and a head full of personal hate, I found
great solace in stories. On top of playing games (which I did a lot of)
I was also a prolific reader. I consumed books like they were air; I
read them as if my very life depended upon them. In some ways my life
probably did. By the time I was 10, I was reading things like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hobbit-There-Back-Again/dp/054792822X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372938975&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=The+Hobbit" title="Amazon - The Hobbit">The
Hobbit</a>
and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Curse-Shadowmage-Forgotten-Realms-The-Harpers/dp/0786901918" title="Amazon - Curse of the Shadowmage">Curse of the
Shadowmage</a>.
My escapism was obvious in retrospect, but what I notice beyond that was
that I loved not only the reprieve from the real world, but the feelings
they brought out.</p>
<p>Like games, I've <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1198481-corey-dutson" title="Goodreads.com - My Profile">read many
books</a> in
my time, and I have enjoyed many, but few become favourites. I've read
so many books that I've started forgetting some of them; my brain only
has so much capacity, and lesser books are ejected to make room for
their betters.</p>
<p>What I personally find interesting is that what makes for a great book,
and what makes for a great game are more or less identical. Sure, you
can't rate the control scheme of a book, but an engaging story, rich
characters, and a narrative that draws me in and <em>makes me care?</em> That
right there is a winner. You can have terrible cover art or a rough font
and I'll still read your book so long as your story is solid. Much like
games: they can have terrible controls, a weak soundtrack, and glaring
graphical issues. I can get around those things if your story is strong
enough, if you make me <em>care</em> about your story.</p>
