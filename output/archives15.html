<p>I wish I could say I listened to indie music more, and that I was well
versed in it. Truly I wish I could, but the fact of the matter is I am
an outsider to the genr√© and as such, my opinion here is literally just
that: opinion. I'm not saying that all my other music reviews are based
on scientifically music-based fact, but at the very least I know what I
like and dislike and can compare it to ...</p>

that not all of them succeed, to which I responded with "those are the

I am unaware of the bands history, I am sure there were at some point or
another other band members. As of right now it is just him, making this
effectively a one-man- fronted band.</p>

<p>Humanistic is a rather dark-feeling album, despite the happy overtones
some of the songs portray. Granted some just put it right out there such

2005 (if you live in North America as I do) this game became an instant
hit and flew off the shelves. Now granted I waited two years before
playing it (since then a second game has come out, and there are a third

bought a DS. I have to make sure to buy my friend Dane a decorative cake

or may not deny it. At least three tracks have clap tracks, and more
then one has what I call "thug beat." I'm not saying these are totally

<p>The basic story is that Henry Powell is blamed for the ruining of his
family at the tender age of seven. After this life-altering event, the
family goes down hill. Mom develops a Valium addiction, the older
brother becomes angsty, and dad just distances himself from his
feelings. I'm not giving away plot twists here, merely the story line.
As a result Henry is burdened with the guilt of this, and spends his
life trying to make it ...</p>

<p>The piano and drums are featured heavily throughout the tracks, though I
use 'heavily' in a loose sense. What I mean to say is they are the
featured instruments throughout their debut album. The whole thing tends
to remind me of a
