I'll start by stating that a [fix I
made](http://www.wallofscribbles.com/?p=14 "bad fix") to the ngGallery
plugin for Wordpress no longer applies, and will actually break your
editor window a tiny bit. If anyone did that, undo it. Someone at the
ngGallery place fixed it.

With that out of the way, I figured I would list off the plugins I've
currently gotten running along with validation as to my use of them. So
here is the list (thus far):

-   [AdSense
    Manager](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/adsense-manager/ "AdSense Manger") -
    This baby makes handling, inserting, and the all around management
    of my [Google
    AdSense](https://www.google.com/adsense/ "Google AdSense") advertisements.
    It allows for me to easily change the styles of the ads (of which I
    can create an unlimited combination therein) as well as insert them
    into my posts with little to no effort. Easy to set up and totally
    worth it.
-   [Category Cloud
    Widget](http://leekelleher.com/wordpress/plugins/category-cloud-widget/ "Category Cloud Widget") -
    An elegantly simple plugin that allows me to show my categories
    displayed in a sort of cloud on my sidebar. Many people display
    these using tags as their cloud feed. I felt that I'd have too many
    cloud items in there and so I opted for this instead. Maybe one day
    I'll swap 'em up but until then I have this.
-   [Cryptographp](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/cryptographp/ "Cryptographp") -
    This plugin is actually disabled at the moment, though I had it
    running for a while and works like a dream. The idea is that it can
    stop spam-bots from commenting in your blog by requiring the user to
    enter a series of characters that are dynamically generated. Works
    well, I just turned it off for now.
-   [Google Analytics for
    Wordpress](http://www.joostdevalk.nl/wordpress/google-analytics/ "Google Analytics for Wordpress") -
    Simply put, this takes all the hard work out of adding JavaScript to
    each post as it does it for you. If you are wondering what [Google
    Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/ "Google Analytics") are,
    it is a very impressive site statistics management system. Even
    better is the fact that it's free, and if you sell ads with Google,
    it ties in with that as well.
-   Hello Dolly - This is a default plugin that recites lines from the
    song in Wordpress. What can i say? i like it
-   [NextGEN
    Gallery](http://alexrabe.boelinger.com/wordpress-plugins/nextgen-gallery/ "NextGEN Gallery") -
    A very impressive image gallery system. It allows for the management
    of images, galleries, and albums. It has additional functionality to
    display galleries as a flash-based slideshow, and uses some crisp
    JavaScript to handle the imagry (LightBo, ThickBo, etc). On top of
    all that it has a wide variety of customization options, and even
    comes with a sidebar widget to display images from your gallery
    (this is a separate plugin that I do not have enabled). For the
    record, this is the same plugin I use for all my posting images, as
    well as the wallpapers and Photos section.
-   [Share This](http://alexking.org/projects/wordpress "Share This") -
    This plugin adds the ability for the end user to share your post on
    a variety of sites such as Digg and del.icio.us. No interface built
    into the back-end, which makes me a bit sad. Maybe in a
    later release.
-   [Twitter
    Tools](http://alexking.org/projects/wordpress "Twitter Tools") - A
    plugin that integrates
    [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com "What are you doing right now...")into
    your Wordpress blog. The end result for this gives you options to
    create digest blogs of all the tweets you've made throughout the
    day, create tweets when you post, and display your tweets (or
    current tweet) on your site. I used the custom php portion of it to
    add a custom Tweet feed to the top of this site. It also allows you
    to write tweets from your Wordpress site, allowing greater ease of
    use and less site-hopping.
-   [Smart Update
    Pinger](http://daven.se/usefulstuff/wordpress-plugins.html "Smart Update Pinger") -
    This plugin makes sure Wordpress doesn't ping my list of services
    every time I edit a post. And considering my spelling ability,
    that's a lot of pings.



As you can see with the last item there, I have become a part of the
[Twitter community](http://twitter.com/ "Twitter.com"). What this is is
a sort of micro-blog wherein you simply answer the question "[What are
you
doing?](http://twitter.com/loveyless "What are you doing right now...")"
With the added plugin, updating this is fairly simple, though i have
noticed that even though I've added a new item the plugin does not get
it automatically. This indicates to me that it's cached in some way.
I'll have to see if I can tweak that. I figure it's a neat way to
possibly generate traffic, and it can't hurt to try and get out into the
interweb communities more.

My friend Bart recently brought up the idea of fonts in coding, and what
people use. He was flat out disgusted with my choice of "Verdana, 8px"
not understanding why I generally choose it. The fact is with the small
font i can simply see more code on the page at any one time. My
workstation has a monitor that is flipped on its side, allowing me to
have a resolution of 1024 x 1280 that I use for coding and branding
purposes (1024 width).

I did realize that it is not a monospaced font, and after thinking about
it I came to the conclusion that he was probably well-justified in his
font-racism. I reviewed the font he uses, and I gotta say that it's
pretty slick. As a result I've swapped up for
"[Inconsolata](http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html "Inconsolata"),
10px." I also got my hands on the new [Komodo Edit
4.2](http://www.activestate.com/Products/komodo_edit/ "Komodo Edit 4.2"),
which I'm going to try out as my source editor to see if it can possibly
replace [EditPlus](http://editplus.com/ "EditPlus")as my main IDE. I
will state that I work with VS.Net practically all day, so this is more
on a personal level.

And to end things off I will point out that I have been making subtle
changes to the sites layout to get it where I want it. It seems to be
coming along nicely.
