### Get a job {#job}

This may sound stupid but if you have the chance to land a job where
your dream-job exists, take it. Sure you may be the mail room jockey
now, but being within a company has two distinct advantages:

1.  Companies tend to hire inside first. Sounds silly, but most
    companies will hire internally before they hire externally. There
    are a lot of reasons to this to which I can only start to speculate.
    I know that there's less paperwork, and you're already familiar with
    the company so that means less time spent on training. All that
    aside, it helps secure employee loyalty and help to provide an
    environment where one can actually move up in the ranks.
2.  Utilizing what are obviously stunning characteristics that you
    possess, such as charisma and charm, you can chum up with those who
    are in or are near or influence your dream position. I don't condone
    playing office politics and being friends with people only to steal
    their job, but I know people do that and I know it works. Personally
    I like the idea of just asking questions and providing input where
    it's available. Eventually people take notice of you and start
    asking you before you have to chip in. It's not as fast as
    shmoozing, but it works.

### Ask not what you can do for your company, but ask what your company can do for you {#ask}

Wherever you work, and whatever you do, see what your company can do to
help you do to further yourself. You would be shocked at some of the
programs that exist. I found out that my company will pay for school
courses, so long as I get over 80% in the course. Not the best of deals,
but it's still something that is offered to me. If nothing is currently
being offered, be the trend setter and ask and/or propose your idea. If
you're going to do this be prepared to answer a slew of questions.
What's it going to do for you? What's it going to do for the company?
How much? How long? etc. . If you think you need it, write up a report
on how this will assist in your contribution to the company and what the
company stands to gain from it. Throw in some pie charts if you know
they like them.

The point I'm trying to get at is that many companies will assist in
educating you in some way. Usually there are strings attached, such as a
mark requirement, or a time-lapse protocol. As always, make sure you
read the fine print before signing anything. Companies usually want to
help their employees but not without expecting something in return, so
be wary.

Make sure to talk to the appropriate people when trying to get ahead.
Sometimes asking your manager could end up getting you nowhere. If
you're company has an HR department, start there. They *usually* have
the what's what when it comes to employee offered arrangements.

What I'm saying is that no matter what company you are in, they are
usually willing to assist their employees if they think it will benefit
the company in the end. Try and figure out the best win/win for this,
and you should be good as gold

### Chat up your co-workers {#chat}

Though office romance may be frowned upon in the office, friendship
usually isn't. If people like you, they're usually more willing to
answer your questions or indulge your curiosity (or nosiness, whichever
you prefer). On top of that, you never know when you'll need someone to
back your character or could provide you with information which could
help you move forward. Make sure to note though that people tend to
share only what they are willing to give away.

Having made that point, make sure you don't shoot yourself in the foot
with your new-found chummy-ness. Being everyones friend can make you a
happier person, but management may frown upon your constant socializing
so try and keep it in check. Beyond that, You should make sure that you
only tell people what you can afford to. If you're friends with someone,
and you know they have the same career goal as you do, you have to be
careful with what you share with them. Sure RSS feeds are fine, even a
neat program or tutorial you found is great. Telling them about a job
opening you just heard about and are applying for... well that could
have adverse effects to your career growth.

### Don't screw anyone {#screw}

Again, office romance may be frowned upon, but screwing your co-workers
(figuratively), though making you fly through the ranks, will leave you
very alone and ripe with the smell of burnt bridges. People hold grudges
for far longer than they will admit to, and if you screw someone to get
ahead, they jump on any chance to return the shaft. I'm assuming the
worst of people here and many may not actually be trying to actively
sabotage you. I'm merely stating what could happen and to take heed.

On top of people actually trying to "get" you, you also ruin a very good
resource. When you screw people over, you close the door on any
information or tidbits they would have otherwise been willing to pass
onto you.The more people you screw, the harder it will become for you to
pull any favors. Education works a lot better when you have many options
in which to pull your resources. If you're down to three contacts, you
had better hope they know *everything*.

### Snoop around {#snoop}

Don't use credit cards to open locks. This isn't 1953, and that never
worked that well to begin with. It's also not what I meant. What I mean
is to simply keep your eyes and your ears open. If you're concentrating
so hard on how to get the boss on your side you may miss that memo that
was posted on the cork board you walk past every morning. Pay attention
to your workplace, and what's going on around you. Make a habit of
checking your internal job postings, if you can. Check
[online](http://www.monster.ca/ "Monster.ca")
[job](http://www.workopolis.com/ "Workopolis.com")
[posting](http://working.canada.com/ "Working.com") sites to see if your
company is looking for anything you could go for. This will also allow
you to see what it is they look for in an employee, which in turn can
use to stark advantage in adjusting your resum√© to be more appealing.

### Donate your two cents to a worthy cause: your future {#donate}

If you are trying to get into an area, sometimes being helpful can go a
long way. I have made it my personal goal to get in on any design
conversations whenever I feel I can contribute. Maybe I'm nothing more
then another pair of eyes, but at least I'm helping out. Even better
when you can contribute something that is taken into consideration
and/or use. When I can't contribute, I'm still listening to what they
say and the observations made. If you cannot contribute to the
discussion, let others contribute to your mental file-folder. I've
learned a lot simply by listening and watching. This has allowed the
commentary that I do contribute to be both more in tune with what my
company wants, and shows that I'm at least slightly knowledgeable in the
area.

On that note do not, **for the love of God**, *do not* comment all the
time. It gets annoying and your "I only wanted to help!" argument will
get you nowhere. You have to make sure to pick your battles wisely and
spaced-appropriately apart.

This is the third part of an ongoing series depicting my process to
becoming a graphic designer. The next article will cover tools and how
to use them. Not people in this case.
