            <p>I've played a lot of videogames in my time. Not as many as some, but
I've been playing console games since I was 3 (at least that's as far
back as I can remember). I've played Sega Master System games, I've
played old 386 PC games, I've played my share of SNES, Playstation,
Gamecube, etc. etc. I've played a whole lot of 'em. But one thing I've
never really done is played a collection of games all the way through
their storyline. I was never good enough at Ultima Underworld, my
computer couldn't handle Warcraft 3, Starcraft 2, or the recently
released Diablo III. Hell, even IPs that exist for the ...</p>

            <p>It's been a while since I've played an honest to God platform game. It's
not my usual bag, as it requires a skill set that is lacking in me.
These games generally consist of accurate timing, good aim, and good
reflexes. These are all things I lack, and so platformers tend to annoy
me to the point of non-playing.</p>
<p>I used to stay as far away from platformers as I could, given that my
ability in them scored somewhere in the negatives. Every time I would
try one, I'd get about 4 levels in, and then start to hate myself. It's
really not a pretty sight. Give me turn-based games and experiences

of customization and unit control that up to that point I couldn't have
dared dream of.</p>

it's own "Internet" that came with spam, conspiracy theories, and
hackable government systems. It had a solid story line, an excellent ...</p>

            <p>Wow, it's been a while since I've done a game review. Could be because
It's been a while since I've played a game through to completion. Sadly
I am finding it hard to make time to dedicate to playing games when
things like school and work are in the way. Pesky thing, responsibility.</p>
<p>Having said that, with my school giving me far too much time off over
the Christmas break, I managed to get my hands on a shiny new XBox 360.
Granted that was a <a href="/2009/01/06/360-degrees-of-failure/" title="Corey Dutson: 360 Degrees of Failure">bit of a

in the end I landed me a couple of games. One of those games (obviously,

<p>The whole album is very mellow, and I could almost class it as an
'easy-listening' but it doesn't quite fit. The songs all feature a
slightly slower beat, and there is emphases on strong musical usage. The
singing is put almost as a second thought, much like the way that The
Strokes perform their music. The music comes before the singing, but
they don't conflict. There is heavy usage of the piano, which stands out
as the major player within most of the tracks ...</p>
