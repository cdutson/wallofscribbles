So recently on
[GraphicRiver](http://graphicriver.net/?ref-Corey%20Dutson "GraphicRiver.net"),
a forum thread came up that basically outlined the following:
"***PHOTOSHOP IS SO SLOW WHY GOD WHY?***" In further investigation the
author did admit he had some aging hardware, which really should be
addressed.

For those of us - myself included - that cannot simply afford to drop
good coin on a 9-dimensional quantum quad core extreme dx processor, 5
gigatonne atomic video card, and RAM the equivalent size and girth of
China, we have to make do with what little things we can.

In this case I've come across a selection of little tweaks you can do to
speed up Photoshop. Maybe not by a massive amount, but when you're used
to 10 seconds of lag, taking a couple seconds off that can make a huge
difference. To your sanity, and to the survival of you and those near
by.

And so I've opted to take them from that forum and post the tips here,
complete with screenshots. I apologize in advance as these screens are
done on my mac. The concepts should still be the same though.<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

Having said all this, if your hardware is truly in need of updating,
these fixes will only help you so far.
