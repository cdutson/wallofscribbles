        <p>Last night I had the fortune to watch <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480249/" title="I Am Legend">I Am
Legend</a> staring Will
Smith. The premise of the movie is that Robert Neville (Will Smith) is
the last man alive, after a deadly super-virus lays waste to 90% of the
worlds population. 1% of man kind had a natural immunity to it, and
9%... well that's something else.</p>
<p>A little slow and pointless off the bat, it feels very typical for the
first 20 minutes or so. Once it has been established that, yes, he is
the only guy around, it gets to the good parts. I shouldn't paint it so
negatively, because I Am Legend does a wonderful job of building
tension. I mean, you know shits gonna go down, and you know it's going
to be hardcore. The movie refuses to throw the viewer into it right off
the bat though, and I have to respect that.</p>
<p>Suffering from flashbacks, Robert has a personal mission that seems to
be the only thing really keeping him from going utterly insane. Packed
with near silent and toned down shots where nothing is said (there's no
one to talk to!) that i felt were used very well in some instances, and
felt awkward in others. On that note, a lot of the shots were
exceptionally well done, and really helped set the mood. There were so
many times that I thought something was going to burst out, B-movie
style, and the film refused to go there. Way to go on that.</p>
<p>Will Smith does a very good job playing his role, and I can honestly say
that he was a very good pick for the film. I can also say that he was
super ripped, and scared the hell out of me with his rugged,
survivalist, man-body. Girls will like this movie simply for him doing
chin-ups. Guys will love the everything else.</p>
<p>Though I am sure it was unintentional the Alpha Male in the movie
reminded me very much of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grendel" title="Grendel">Grendel</a> in the <a href="http://www.beowulfmovie.com/" title="Beowulf">CG'ed
version</a> of
<a href="/2007/11/30/beowulf/" title="Beowulf">Beowulf</a>. I'm not sure how that worked
out, but sadly it really hurt my perception of the character and made it
hard to take that part of the movie seriously. I'm sorry, but the
hilarity I found in Beowulf really hurt the team on this one, and I
can't really hold it against the film itself and so I tried to avoid
that when making my marking decision.</p>
<p>I will say (without giving anything away) that the ending really irked
me. I can't explain why without giving away the movie, but I got to be
honest, I hate when that exact situation occurs. If or when you see the
movie, you'll at least know what I'm talking about. All in all though, I
cannot rag on the movie that much. It is what it is, and that's about
it. It won't win any awards, but it's a good movie in the end.</p>
