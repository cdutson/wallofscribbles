I've been using a MacBook for almost a year now - 10 months, but who's
counting - and I've come to appreciate the small section of Mac apps
that are easy on my wallet. More so as I'm a poor student, any useful
programs that I can use and not cost me money?

Perfect.

So without further delay, here is my giant list of (mostly) free mac
apps.

### Adium



I heart [VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org/ "VirtualBox"). I don't
even need to run it all that often, but I still love it. As I use a Mac,
it is generally thought that I cannot run any Windows applications
because Microsoft and Mac don't play well together. Well with the new
Mac software, you can do a dual-boot into Windows. This is all well and
good, but most people don't want to have to reboot their computer in
order to run Windows.

This has lead to programs such as
[Parallels](http://www.parallels.com/ "Parallels"),
[Coherence](http://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/features/coherence/ "Coherence"),
and [Fusion](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/ "Fusion"). The issue
with all of *these* solutions is that they cost money. I'll admit that
they all work well and are probably worth every penny. I, however,
prefer not spending money when possible. This of course has lead me to
[VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org/ "VirtualBox").

[VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org/ "VirtualBox") works by creating
a sandbox environment for your new operating system. It's sort of like
picture in picture, with your Windows (or Ubuntu, or whatever) build
running in a window. What really makes VirtualBox shine is that a) you
can full-screen the environment making you "feel" like your in windows,
b) you can make network drives to folders in your Mac (allowing you to
share files between builds), and c) you can customize the beejeezus out
of your box. How much RAM you want, what ports are enabled,
localization, everything.

If you're looking for a way to run your install of Windows on a Mac, and
don't have any more money because you spent it all on your install of
Windows, then make sure to check out
[VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org/ "VirtualBox").

Conclusion
----------

So there you have it, a collection of programs I use on my Mac, and I've
only paid for one of them. I think that's a pretty good track record if
I do say so myself. I hope that my quest to not spend money for programs
will assist you, the reader, in doing much the same.

If you have anything to add to my list, feel free to comment them in
this post.
