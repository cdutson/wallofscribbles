>  Excerpt from Gods Behaving Badly

As I somewhat gave away in my opener, the story revolves around two
parties. The first is the Greek Pantheon. The main pantheon live in a
crummy townhouse in London that is utterly run-down and otherwise
falling apart. They hate each other, though that's never been a secret.
The second part is the small and simple lives of Alice and Neil. They're
simple cuteness and obvious affection for each other (though hiding it
*from* each other) makes reading any interaction with them impossible
without smiling.

Did I mention that Aphrodite is a phone-sex operator, and Artemis walks
dogs? I'll admit that these were the selling points for me. That and the
cover art which is pretty much fantastic in every way.



As I stated earlier, the book is somewhat of a light look at the crisis
facing the Greek Gods. This can be annoying if what you were looking for
was something with a bit more depth. Gods Behaving Badly is about as
deep as the shallow-end of a pool. It's loads of fun to read with great
writing and fantastic dialog. I have to give high praise to the
Ares-induced fight in the book, because that just blew my mind. The
novel also deals out enough detail for you to put it all together, but
does leave much of it to the readers imagination which I'm sure can be
taken as either a pro or a con.

My main issue with the book is two-fold, though their related so I don't
know what sort of fold that would make. The first is that it is too
shallow. Sure it's a fun read, but there is a distinct lack of character
to the Gods that really should be there. I mean they *are* gods, after
all. Neil and Alice deserved a bit more development as well because they
were fantastic characters, but never quite make it for me. My second
problem is that it wasn't long enough. I say this because had there been
an extra hundred pages, the story could have been that much better. The
ending felt a tad rushed, and like I said, the character development
just isn't all there.

Pick it up and give it a read, you'll be glad you did. It's pretty
short, it's entertaining the entire way through, and it'll leave you
feeling warm and tingly inside. Like having a fever but without the
sweating, hallucinations, or accompanied sickness.

8.5/10
