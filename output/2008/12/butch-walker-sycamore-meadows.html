        <p>I have been waiting for a long, long time for a new album to come
rolling out from <a href="http://www.butchwalker.com/" title="Butch Walker">this man</a>.
The album was supposed to come out a while ago, but when your house
burns down due to some forest fires that are ruining the local
forestry... well I can understand a delay.</p>
<p>Thankfully after my faithful wait, I have been rewarded with his new
release: <a href="http://gomerch.com/interface/body.php?module=store&amp;catid=15&amp;id=34" title="Butch Walker: Sycamore Meadows">Sycamore
Meadows</a>.
After giving this album a couple of listens, it has quickly become one
of my favorites for all time. It's both amazingly happy and startlingly
deep, many times simultaneously. <!--more--></p>

<p>Once again, I'll try and avoid gushing like the ridiculous fan-boy that
I am for Butch Walker. It's just so hard when he's so god-damned good.</p>
<p>Wait, that wasn't biased was it? Nah.</p>
<p>So ... <a href="http://gomerch.com/interface/body.php?module=store&amp;catid=15&amp;id=34" title="Butch Walker: Sycamore Meadows">Sycamore
Meadows</a>.
How can I describe this? Well it's an label-free release by Butch
Walker, newest in the line up (as of this post in any case). It's far
more "home-grown" than his previous stuff, with a lot more country
influence than anything else he's put out. After much consideration,
I've opted to class this as a fusion between blue-grass and alt-rock.
I'm sure blue-grass and alt-rock fans will both probably hate on me for
saying that. Yes, I just said "hate on me." Live with it.</p>
<p>I've been listening to this album at least once a day since I got it (
which isn't as much as you'd think, as it came out in November. Shipping
was <em>painfully</em> slow) and I have finally managed to clearly define what
songs that I cannot live without, and what songs I simply cannot stand.
Others require a mood for me to enjoy them, otherwise they are very
quickly skipped over. I have this nagging feeling that I won't be alone.
Much like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letters_%28album%29" title="Wikipedia: Butch Walker - Letters">his</a>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Is_Me..._Justified_and_Stripped" title="Wikipedia: Butch Walker - This Is Me... Justified And Stripped">other</a>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_of_Self-Centered" title="Wikipedia: Butch Walker - Left of Self-Centered">albums</a>,
Butch seems to have a knack for being very hit or miss with his songs.
He also has a knack for making sure that these songs hit and miss
differently.</p>
<p>get_leader</p>
<p>One thing that has been constant throughout all of his work though, is
that every track has a personal touch. There have been many a time where
I have sat there wondering "did this actually happen to him or what?"
The fact that I have such trouble discerning between fact and fiction
only helps to demonstrate that everything feels like it was pulled from
his past, dusted off, and arranged around. ATL is by far the best
example of this, and <a href="http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&amp;VideoID=42913631" title="Butch Walker: Ships In A Bottle">the video for Ships In A
Bottle</a>
was filmed in the ruins of Butch's former home. It's the little things
like this that really help make you more than just listen to the album;
you <em>feel</em> it as well. This is probably what sets him apart as a
fantastic musical artist in my mind.</p>
<p>I think the only complaint I can actually have with the album is
literally that some of the tracks are almost entirely unlistenable (I am
very sure I just made "unlistenable" up). Ponce De Leon Ave. ranks top
on my list of "cannot stand whatsoever" with "Here comes the..." coming
at a close second. Everything else that wasn't starred simply requires
me to be in the right mood.</p>
<p>Regardless of the hit and miss nature of the tracks, I implore any and
everyone who likes alternative, country, blue grass, Alt Rock, Indie,
and just plain ol' good music to give Sycamore Meadows a listen or
three.</p>
