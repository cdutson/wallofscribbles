        <p>Every once in a while, you are told about a game that sounds just a
little too ridiculous to be true. Just something that's a little too far
off the beaten path that you simply have to play it, if only to know
that it exists. <a href="http://www.atlus.com/" title="Atlus">Atlus</a> published a game
called <a href="http://www.atlus.com/myworldmyway/" title="My World, My Way">My World, My
Way</a>, and it
easily fit the mark.</p>
<p>When it was originally described to me first one eyebrow was raised, and
then the other. Then my face had no where to go, and so my eyebrows
fluctuated back and forth. I eventually got my hands on it, and was
actually surprised.</p>
<p>Turns out it didn't suck!<!--more--></p>
<p>[singlepic id=624 w=425 h=425]</p>
<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<p>You're a spoiled Princess (Elise) with romantic notions of having an
adventurer boyfriend.</p>
<p>Yes, this is actually a key story element. In fact, it is the catalyst
for the whole damned story.</p>
<p>Anyways, you decide to whine to your father until he throws a huge ball
and invites all of the adventurers and blue blood to the ball. There she
falls for an adventurer who she thinks is the bomb digity. A humorous
scene unfolds where they talk and fall madly in love, only to end up
being a day dream. The reality is that the adventurer wants nothing to
do with your spoiled, prissy butt, and mentions that you have no idea
what it's like out in the real world.</p>
<p>He then takes off, and the Princess's mind is blown completely. So
completely that she decides that she's going to cut her hair, put on
some stylish outside clothing, and go off to become an adventurer
herself. The King, thinking that his daughter will surely be killed,
hires the lands greatest hero, Nero. Nero's job is to create quests
around the Princess to give her the illusion that she's adventuring.
Actors are hired, and the hilarity begins.</p>
<p>That is until an actual enemy starts to watch the Princess, worried that
she could be a threat.</p>
<h2>Mechanics</h2>
<p>My World, My Way have three major sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first is the over-all world map, which is sectioned off into
    4 quadrants. You can only visit one at a time.</li>
<li>The second is a grid system of land-tiles for each town/area. There
    are a collection of areas within each quadrant. Each land tile has a
    set amount of enemy encounters, and have their own attributes
    (plains vs forest vs farm field etc.).</li>
<li>The third are dungeons, which are located within certain areas. The
    dungeons are a 3rd person 3/4 view of the Princess, and you navigate
    the hallways fighting monsters that you come across.</li>
</ul>
<p>The quests work in one of two ways. Either you are <em>collecting</em> things
(which can be found either in dungeons or by searching the land-tiles),
or you are <em>killing</em> things (in either dungeons or land-tiles). The
result is that you get a gate key or crest (or both) and away you go to
the next area. Very straight-forward, and after the first few times of
doing it, very boring. There are side quests which usually involve you
killing a million of a certain enemy to find an item to return. The
rewards are usually worth it though.</p>
<p>Where the game actually starts to show some true originality (other than
the solid script and light humor) is in the stats available to the
player:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Speed</strong>: How fast you are (what order you will fight in battle...
    most of the time), and how often your attacks will hit.</li>
<li><strong>Will</strong>: How strong your magical attacks are, and how strong your
    magical defense is.</li>
<li><strong>Strength</strong>: How strong your attack is.</li>
<li><strong>Constitution</strong>: How high your defense is.</li>
<li><strong>HP</strong>: Your health. If this hits zero, you're dead. Actually, not
    dead, but you take a penalty; half of your Money, or half of your
    Experience earned that day. Refresh your health by sleeping or by
    using a potion / elixir.</li>
<li><strong>MP</strong>: Your magic. You use these to cast magic. Refresh your magic
    by sleeping at an in, or consuming a magic potion.</li>
<li><strong>PP</strong>: Your Pout Points. Now this is an interesting addition. Being
    a spoiled princess, you can pout to get what you want. This
    translates into the actual world. You can use your pout points to
    change the terrain, make enemies weaker, find more items, gain more
    experience, and more. The only way to refill your pout points is to
    sleep at an inn. Trust me when I say that they are by far the most
    useful thing you can have.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you gain stats naturally through leveling, but unlike most games,
the stat increases from your levels are minimal at best. You get most of
your upgrades by eating foods at the local Inn. You will end up spending
a good amount of coin on food. You won't get far without it.</p>

<h2>Words from the Wise</h2>
<p>It took me a good while to play through this game (44 hours)Â  and so I
think I am qualified to give advice on how to get through this game
faster than I did.</p>
<p><strong>Upgrade your stats</strong>: I cannot enforce this one enough. Upgrading your
stats will make your life easier all around. concentrate on strength and
defense at the start, later on add to your wisdom and speed. Speed only
needs to be around 100 by the end of the game, so it's not nearly as
important as the others. everything else should be at least 130 by the
time you get to the final battle. To make your life easier, I'd even try
to get your strength and Will to around 150. Failing that, use the Might
spell.</p>
<p><strong>Upgrade your Pout Points</strong>: You will use these more often than you
think, and it's in your best interests to make sure you get this number
high. I had over 300 by the end fight, which is all I ended up needing.</p>
<p><strong>Fight every battle</strong>: On the tile maps, fight in every square. If you
can pout for more experience and money, do it. It speeds everything up
and makes fighting more worth it. I was level 69 when I got to the final
map, that was 10 under the recommended. On that map, you'll feel it. I
ended up grinding my character to level 86 just to have a chance in the
final fight.</p>
<p><strong>Make enemies harder in dungeons</strong>: You are more likely to fight
singular enemies in dungeons, and they are naturally a little higher in
level than those above ground. When you are trying to upgrade your mimic
buddy stronger parts, this is the best way to do it. On top of that, you
get more experience and money for your effort.</p>
<p><strong>Do all the side quests</strong>: You'll get better loot and spells from the
side-quests than you ever will from simply fighting through the map (the
final dungeon is an exception).</p>
<p><strong>Pay attention to the end of battles</strong>: You'll end up getting a partner
that can mimic enemies. The menu shows up at the end of battles
randomly, and if you are blindly mashing the A button (like I was) you
end up taking body parts that you really didn't want.</p>
<h2>Overall</h2>
<p>It's not as girly as you'd think. Other than being about a spoiled
princess and having armor available to wear called "Princess Boots" and
the like, it's not all that girl-driven. The box art is more
girl-oriented than the rest of the game.</p>
<p>The music was solid, the artwork was fantastic (and reminded me a lot of
Professor Layton), and the graphics were about as good as you would
expect for a DS. Good pixel art, and fairly decent 3D work.</p>
<p>As for the fun factor,Â  <a href="http://www.atlus.com/myworldmyway/" title="My World, My Way">My World, My
Way</a> is fun for
the first three quarters. When you get into the final area the story
gets much lighter, and it feels more like a grind-fest. Hell the final
battle couldn't be any more anti-climactic if it tried. Considering how
difficult that final battle was, I was a little shocked that I actually
had to walk out of the dungeon myself. I was expecting a cut scene or
something. When you get the final gate key, you go home, have a 5 minute
conversation, and then the credits roll.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.atlus.com/myworldmyway/" title="My World, My Way">My World, My
Way</a> has
absolutely no re-play value. It'll eat away your time when you play
through it the first time, but that's about it. The writing is solid,
and the humor is light, but enjoyable. You'll smile through most of the
dialogue, and you'll even enjoy the short but sweet ending.</p>
<p>If you're forced to grind for 8 hours in the final area like I was, the
game will lose much of its appeal, and you'll be wishing a painful death
on the developers of the game. That's partially my fault though. I was
trying to fly through the game, and I was hoisted by my own petard.</p>
<p>Worth playing through once, but I expect to see a lot of used copies of
this game sitting in the shelf at your local Gamestop.</p>
