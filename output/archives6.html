            <p>Let's have a little fun with this post. The idea came to me randomly
through the evening, and by now it's been stewing in my brain for just
long enough to have it start to make sense. I could also be going a tad
insane from school, but I have no way of proving that as of yet.</p>
<p>So here's the idea: I'm going to pick a word at random, and then
continue writing down all the words and first thoughts I have based on
that word and everything that follows. Things may not actually follow in
a fluid pattern. I'm sure this will be a clear window into the dark
regions of my mind ...</p>

new bouncy favorites. The only way I can describe them is disco acid

for lack of the creation of new words.</p>
<p>As an aside, I want to apologize for the title of this post. I'm using
the normal format, but their first album is actually called "Datarock
Datarock" so it makes for some crummy article titling.</p>

well that I won't be the last. That aside, I have little choice but to
talk about The Last Lecture. I meant to talk about the original online

somewhat of a morbid coincidence, but it's true and I can't tell you how

            <p>That's sort of a crime, don't you think? They have two major parties,
and the candidates vie for supremacy until it is down to two
presidential candidates and their running mates. Then those two groups
campaign for over a year, and then on election night, every possible
station is glued to the election and they bust out some sweet technology
to make all this shit that much cooler. To top it all off, at the end of
the night, both the winner and the loser give solid, stand-along
speeches that actually make you nod your head, tear-up, or just feel
proud.</p>

else? After reading the book itself, I can actually say that 1984 does
it better than any movie ever could.</p>
<p>1984 paints a future (well alright, past technically) where there is no
law, and yet everyone fears to break it. A land so poor, yet constantly
boasting it's over-manufacturing. A world so controlled, that the past

It's fast, it's simple, and so long as your website isn't gaining huge

great selection. It's fairly customizable, <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/" title="Wordress: Extend">has a huge support and user
