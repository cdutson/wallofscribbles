            <p><a href="http://wallofscribbles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/map-final.jpg"><img alt="Navig8 - The final
design" src="http://wallofscribbles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/map-final.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>I was approached by <a href="http://www.jac-group.co.uk/" title="JAC Interiors">JAC
Interiors</a> to create a
large world-map-style decal for
<a href="http://www.navig8group.com/" title="Navig8 group">Navig8's</a> new office
interior. The project had a short timeline and I had never done any
vinyl on glass work before, but I was keen.</p>
<p>After providing some initial numbers, we came to a figure and I got to
work. I was provided a rough sketch of what JAC were looking to install
as well as the contact information for the team responsible for Navig8's
new branding. It was part of my job to talk with the brand team to
collect all of the colours and guidelines for using the new brand. I
also went the extra step in getting their brand font for use in the
design. It wasn't a requirement for the project, but I just wasn't
willing to use Arial when it was that easy to bring in more of Navig8's
brand.</p>
<p>I also had to discuss options with the printer for what we were going to
actually do to with the actual decal. I pushed for using all Pantones
due to the use of transparencies, but this ended up beng
cost-prohibitive. In the end, we had to work together to make sure the
dot spread of the CMYK transparencies worked properly.</p>
<p><a href="http://wallofscribbles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/map-alternative.jpg"><img alt="Navig8 - The alternative
design" src="http://wallofscribbles.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/map-alternative.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>The design itself was a straight-forward one: Navig8 wanted a world map
showing the locations of their offices, their brand, as well as a colour
strap featuring the primary colours from their brand. The actual
construction didn’t take long as the whole project was a vector - done
in Illustrator. I put together a couple options for the client and let
them decide what worked better. I personally preferred the gradient, but
they had final say and went for the distinct bars.</p>
<p>Once we had sign off of the design, the JAC worked with the printer to
do some test prints to trial the design. A couple of transparency tweaks
were needed in order to get everything just right. The printers ended up
doing that work, though the did state that the organization of the AI
file made it a very simple task. It was faster for them to make the
changes rather than sending it back to me to make the tweaks.</p>
<p>The design was installed without incident, and Navig8 are very happy
with the end product.</p>
