As I've voiced my opinion over and over (and over), applied my own twist
to things, and finally catching the ear of the designer at my current
job, I've finally got my foot in the door for doing some graphic design
work. Together, the designer and I were really going to blow away the
old designs with a fresh look, new design rules to apply, and a good
application of experience.

I was going to finally get my chance to do what I've been asking to do
for almost two years! So why did I give it up?

### The Paper

First and foremost, unless you're a prodigy of design, the messiah of
the layout, and the master of typography, people aren't going to pay
much attention to your opinion unless you've got some documentation
backing you. It's the sad truth, and it's one of the driving forces
behind my decision. You can be as good as you possibly can, but without
that little "G.D" title under your list of can-dos, you have to work
that much harder just to prove that your the designer for the job.

Once I complete my stint at Mohawk College, I'll probably upgrade via a
distance course so that I can work in the field and gain experience
while upgrading my educational status. That part's going to suck
socially, economically, physically, and mentally but I'll manage. I just
remind myself that perpetual learning is the most important thing in
life you can do for yourself and your community.

### The Experience

I want to learn about design in a structured environment. I know I've
been reading like a fiend since I started on this road, but reading
books only gets you so far without proper application of knowledge. I'm
hoping and somewhat expecting to get this foundation from school. I
don't want to be just another designer; I want to be a bloody-good
designer. I want people to look at my work and say something akin to
"Fuck. Yes."

I know I won't be able to do that without a strong foundation and
understanding of the rules of design. School can help me with this.

### The Direction

My work's been rewarding. Sure I've worked 40 hour-per-day shifts, been
sat behind the eight ball more times than I'm willing to count, and I'm
sure I've lost hair from the whole ordeal. I've also been taught some
rather good habits about how to work under pressure, know just what my
abilities are and how to push them, and I know just how much I enjoy my
work.

Having said that, being a code-jockey for the rest of my life is not
what I have planned. I enjoy coding, and I like it being a part of what
I do. I do not want it to be the main focus of my work because over the
last two years I've come to the conclusion that I like design work more.
It appeals to me, and I appeal to it. I would be short-changing myself
if I waited too long before getting my formal education in the field.

As it turns out, my place of employment have actually offered me a part
time job where I set my hours weekly. If I can't work, it's no big deal.
They're also willing to pay me my current rate of pay in an hourly
format. That's.. roughly 30 dollars an hour in a part time job. I admit
that it's tempting, and I've got to give that some thought.

### The Drive

I want to do this. I want to become a designer and there's nothing
anyone can really say to dissuade me. I know becoming a designer will
require a pay cut, at least at the beginning. I know that it's a flooded
field at the moment since everyone and their mother thinks that they can
design. I know that it'll be hard for me to stand out, but I will.

I will do this.

I will complete my schooling.

I will distinguish myself.

I will be a designer.

I will be proud of my work.
