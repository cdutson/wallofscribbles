            <p>I'm bringing this up from an exceptionally small thing I noticed while
at work today. As I have previously stated, I work with
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepointserver/FX100492001033.aspx" title="Microsoft SharePoint 2007">SharePoint</a>.
Much of the time I am branding it (though not in my current project!)
and so I have a rather intimate and abusive relationship with the
program. I find myself constantly finding weird styling quirks put into
the environment that prove that SharePoint was built by a large group of
people.</p>
<p>There are many instances within SharePoint - and I'm sure within
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepointtechnology/FX100503841033.aspx" title="Microsoft WSS 3,0">WSS</a>
as well - where certain styles that should be consistent end up being
done completely different ways. I wish I had a screen shot as an
example, but you'll have to use ...</p>

            <p>Some people had to reset the time on their computer. Some had to
un-check the starting options (Remember me, Remember Password, and Auto

from their registry, and some even had to repair Messenger and its

another Microsoft decided to totally cut off from their whole service. I
mean a total cut off. I couldn't access their service, I'd get a 404

<p>This man feels the music, the likes of which I haven't seen in a good
long while. His music was heart-felt and well composed. Even when he did
his song "State of the Union" which was more of a spoken poem and
performance art, he obviously felt his music.</p>

and started off by re-imaging the thing to factory settings. This means
I have Windows XP: Home Edition, and not much else. I figured that if
nothing else I could have a laptop with windows on it for when I go
around places. This was not the goal though, as I really want to get
into some python coding. I don't feel like struggling to get python and
Apache running on my main desktop, and even less with fighting with them
to run in Windows.</p>

            <p>Fast forward to my current job. I can assure you that there are a
plethora of examples that I could choose from for the point I will be
making here, but one strikes me as perfect. You see when we developers
started there things were volatile, unstructured, and pretty much a
mess. My now fellow programmers and myself were hired in the wake of a
collection of other developers leaving for one reason or another. We
were also thrust into a project pretty much from the moment we sat in
our chairs.</p>

<p>I wish I could summarize this book properly, but it seems to be many
stories unfolding in one. There are even stories within stories that are
nothing less than vivid and unnerving. The Doctor goes to investigate
temporal disturbances going on in modern-day Earth only to find The

Chronovores. The plan goes to hell and a new creature ...</p>
