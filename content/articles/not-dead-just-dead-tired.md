So as some of you may have noticed, I didn't post at all last week.
Quite simply, this is because I spent pretty much every waking hour at
work. Hell I gave up sleeping hours to be there to. Wednesday I was at
work for 18 hours, got 4 hours of sleep, then went to work the next day
for a fun-filled 31-hour shift. A word to the wise, if you are ever
installing [ISA
server](http://www.microsoft.com/isaserver/prodinfo/default.mspx "Microsoft ISA Server 2006")
into your topology, for the love of all that is sacred and pure make
sure you put it onto a separate server then the one holding your
website. Trust me on this. Unless you want to be awake at 3 am, 6 hours
before your project is being presented to 100 important people and your
environment being totally bollocksed.

Another helpful tidbit: if you are tired enough, you can actually sleep
on a cement floor! I proved this by passing out in our conference room
for nearly two hours. I say passed out because it wasn't sleep in any
sense. I actually felt worse when I was roused. Ah well, such is my
work-life.

Onto the random paragraphs that summarize my life in the past little
while!

I've been obsessed with the newest season of [Sam &
Max](http://www.telltalegames.com/samandmax/ "Telltale Games: Sam & Max")
by [Telltale Games](http://www.telltalegames.com/ "Telltale Games").
This season (with the exception of one episode) blows the first season
out of the water. I'm not saying that the first season is bad, far from
in actuality, but this seasons writing and direction are much tighter
than the last season, and I'm rather looking forward to the last
installment. I pray that they continue making more seasons.

There's a new [Dentyne
commercial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiW4ZMqwvgg "Youtube.com: Dentyne Ice - 'Stuttering'")
out that I'm in love with, and thanks to a little investigation Theresa
and I found the band that made the song. [Ben's
Brother](http://www.bensbrother.com/ "Ben's Brother") is the culprit,
and after listening to their myspace page, I went and tracked down their
2007 album: "Beta Male Fairytales". It turns out that though
'Stuttering' will be a super hit single, the rest of their music is
pretty much top-end awesome. I've officially become a fanboy of them and
pray that they visit Canada at some point in the future. I'll make sure
to do a review of the album this week. For those looking for a copy of
the track (which cannot be downloaded from the bands [MySpace
page](http://www.myspace.com/bensbrothermusic "MySpace: Ben's Brother")
there is another [MySpace
page](http://www.myspace.com/bensbrot "MySpace: Bensbrot") that features
the download. How long it'll be up I don't know so I suggest getting it
while it's 'hot'.

So a new [Panic! At The
Disco](http://www.panicatthedisco.com/ "Panic! At The Disco") album came
out. Considering how hyped up the first CD was, I'm a little shocked
that this went so under the radar. I'll admit I liked them when I first
heard of them (I was visitor 63 on their
[MySpace](http://www.myspace.com/panicatthedisco "MySpace: Panic! At The Disco")
way back in the day.. and I still have their original 3 track releases).
Then they got huge and over-played. Then they disappeared. I was
expecting them to burn hot and then fizzle out after the first album.
Then I heard about "[Pretty.
Odd.](http://store.fueledbyramen.com/albumview.asp?idproduct=50778 "Panic! At The Disco: Pretty. Odd.")"
two days before the release date. I got my hands on a copy recently and
I've gotta say that it's a drastic departure from their last album. "A
Fever You Can't Sweat Out" was all about being bouncy and energetic and
borderline insane. "Fairly Odd" is toned down and dare I say, a more
matured sound than before. I don't know whether I like it or not. I'll
try and review their newest album this week as well.

I was recently recommended an artist called [Matt
McIntosh](http://www.myspace.com/mmcintoshsk1 "MySpace: Matt McIntosh")
on Last.Fm and I have to say that I'm at least a little impressed. Very
haunting, toned down, with a weird-hollow voiced sound to it. I'll try
and review this one when I get the chance. Apparently he's [made a lot
of
music](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_McIntosh "Wikipedia: Matt McIntosh")
in the past.

Last thing to note, I've been getting more into Twitter, though I'm not
entirely sure why.

Until next time folks.
