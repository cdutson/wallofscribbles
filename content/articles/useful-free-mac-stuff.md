I've been using a MacBook for almost a year now - 10 months, but who's
counting - and I've come to appreciate the small section of Mac apps
that are easy on my wallet. More so as I'm a poor student, any useful
programs that I can use and not cost me money?

Perfect.

So without further delay, here is my giant list of (mostly) free mac
apps.<!--more-->

Communication
-------------

### Adium

\[singlepic id=633 w=119 h=119 float=left\]

[Adium](http://www.adium.im/ "Adium Chat Client") is basically ***the***
chat client on the Mac. Since Microsoft's version of [Mac
MSN](http://www.microsoft.com/Mac/products/messenger/default.mspx "Mac MSN 7")
looks and acts like the original Microsoft messenger did, people have
tried to find different chat clients that can pick up the slack. I'm
sure there are others, but Adium is my clear choice for this.

Out of the box, [Adium](http://www.adium.im/ "Adium Chat Client")
supports 20 services including (but not limited to): MSN, Yahoo!, AIM,
and Google Talk. Hell it even has support (albeit a little shaky) for
Facebook and Twitter. Beyond this there is a large collection of
plug-ins that extend the functionality of this already robust program.

It's also got a slew of options to customize the look and feel of the
program, Growl support, and a whole boatload of customization options.

There are only two major limitations to Adium, and I'm not entirely sure
one is their fault. The first is that Adium supports the viewing of
custom smileys, but to date I have no figured out how to add my own. The
second is that there is no sharing box. This was a big blow to me, as I
was using my sharing folder *a lot* with the windows version of MSN.

### Beak

\[singlepic id=634 w=119 h=119 float=left\]

Raise your hand if you use
[Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/Corey%20Dutson "Twitter: Corey Dutson").
Yeah, you and a gazillion other people. With the recent super-adoption
of Twitter, applications to sift through the mass of 140 character
messages are becoming more plentiful, more powerful, and way prettier. I
know a lot of people will advocate for
[TweetDeck](http://tweetdeck.com/ "TweetDeck"), and I wouldn't disagree;
[TweetDeck](http://tweetdeck.com/ "TweetDeck") is a fantastic program if
you're *really* into Twitter and/or have large screen real estate.

For those of us who have small screens,
[TweetDeck](http://tweetdeck.com/ "TweetDeck") is just too big to be
practical. It literally takes up 90% of the screen, and that's not
something I want when I'm doing quick alt-tabs.
[Beak](http://beakapp.com/ "Beak") fills in this role quite nicely.

Thankfully there is a huge list of [Mac-Twitter
applications](http://twitter.pbworks.com/MacApps "Twitter Fan Wiki: MacApps")
in the Twitter wiki, but the big ones are generally
[TweetDeck](http://tweetdeck.com/ "TweetDeck"),
[Twhirl](http://www.twhirl.org/ "Twhirl"),
[Twidget](http://gettwidget.com/ "Twidget"), and
[Tweetie](http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-mac/ "Tweetie").
[Beak](http://beakapp.com/ "Beak") isn't as big as some of the others
and it's still in Beta, but since it's most recent release it's been
amazingly stable and does everything I need. Tweetie is pretty solid,
and similar to [Beak](http://beakapp.com/ "Beak") (with some
differences), but I don't really want to pay 20 dollars American just to
use Twitter (yes I'm aware there is a free, ad-supported version. That's
not much better.)

You get everything you'd expect from a solid twitter app - posting
tweets/DMs, ReTweet, Favoriting, mentions, search, and link statuses -
but with none of the cost. Now you can't have multi-user support,
something I personally don't need to worry about, nor do you get
TweetDeck's Multi-column viewing. Everything that is featured is offered
in a tabular view, meaning that you can easily switch between views. It
also has a neat feature to display a users twitter information inline.

Everyday
--------

### Firefox

\[singlepic id=639 w=119 h=119 float=left\]

Let's be honest here. I don't need to advocate for a browser that
[advocates for
itself](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/personal.html "Mozilla Firefox").
I'll say that I'm not a fan of Safari, as I've always found the
interface to be a little wonky. I know there are other options out
there: [Camino](http://caminobrowser.org/ "Camino"),
[Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome "Google Chrome"),Â 
[Flock](http://www.flock.com/ "Flock"),
[Opera](http://www.opera.com/ "Opera"),
[SeaMonkey](http://www.seamonkey-project.org/ "The SeaMonkey Project"),
[Shiira](http://shiira.jp/en "Shiira"), and I'm sure there are many,
many more. I've been with Firefox for a while, and it's done me well.
I'm not a zealot, but even I must admit that Firefox does it's job, and
it does it well.

Hell I've been using Firefox since it was called
[Phoenix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Firefox "Wikipedia: Mozilla Firefox").
That's how old school I am. ***Kick it***.

### Thunderbird + Lightning

\[singlepic id=646 w=119 h=119 float=left\]

I'm aware the Mac comes with Mail and iCal, but neither of them are all
that impressive. They're light-weight, and do their jobs with minimal
imagination. I tried mail out for all of 5 minutes before I was sick of
it and downloading Thunderbird. Ditto for iCal.

[Thunderbird](http://www.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/thunderbird/ "Mozilla Thunderbird")
is Mozilla's local mail system. It has all the bells and whistles that
you would expect from a mailing system, but it's free. Sadly it's not as
polished as say, Microsoft Outlook - lets just pretend they're not going
to use [Word to render
emails](http://www.email-standards.org/blog/entry/microsoft-to-ignore-web-standards/ "Email Standards Project")
for a minute - but it does it's job and does it well. It has rule
support, multiple account management, and a crap-tonne of other features
making it a very appealing option to those who don't want to log into a
website to check their mail.

But what is an email client without a calendar system? Light-weight,
yes, but not nearly as useful.

That is where
[Lightning](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/lightning/ "Mozilla Lightning")
comes in to play. Now on it's own, Lightning is very much like iCal, if
iCal tried a little harder. Lightning can hook into services like Google
Calendar (so can iCal, I know) and allow you to actually create events,
tasks, and everything else with amazing ease (something iCal does not
do).

Now they've gone and [developed a
plug-in](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/2313 "Thunderbird Plugins: Lightning")
that gives you all of the abilities of lightning, integrated into
Thunderbird. This effectively removes the need for an additional program
running. One less thing running is always a boon to me.

### Jomic

\[singlepic id=641 w=119 h=119 float=left\]

Back when
[Watchmen](http://watchmenmovie.warnerbros.com/ "Watchmen: The Movie")
was coming out, I had no idea of the story specifics. This resulted in
my having to read the entire story in one sitting. Now I didn't mean for
this to happen, but as it worked out Watchmen was a fantastic graphic
novel, and [Jomic](http://jomic.sourceforge.net/ "Jomic") was a
fantastic comic reader.

[Jomic](http://jomic.sourceforge.net/ "Jomic") is a sourceforge project,
and though their website was obviously developed by a programmer, their
program has a solid finish to it. Now I've tried a couple comic viewers
for the Mac but I can assure you that Jomic was both the smoothest
functioning and simplest to use.

It features nifty abilities such as being able to go straight into the
next comic in the series (I assume this works off the concept that every
comic is within the same folder), two page spreads, zooming, and
keyboard navigation. If you want to read comics on your computer (those
not in the 'web' format), Jomic is totally the way to go.

### NeoOffice

\[singlepic id=642 w=119 h=119 float=left\]

There is absolutely no shortage of [Mac text
processors](http://www.thefreecountry.com/utilities/wordprocessors.shtml "The Free Country: Mac Word Processors")
out there. Given that the list is as long as I am tall, it's hard to
pick out a sure-winner. NeoOffice is not by any means a sure winner, but
it does it's job.

Now I cannot explain all of the many things that NeoOffice apparently
does, as I've only ever used the Text and Spreadsheet portions of it.
What I can say is that from what I've used, everything worked as
expected (minor visual hiccups aside).

I can't gush over NeoOffice, because to be honest I haven't had to use
it that much. I've recently found myself gravitating more towards
[Google Docs](http://docs.google.com/ "Google Documents"), which is
filling the need for a text editor pretty well.

### Smultron

\[singlepic id=645 w=119 h=119 float=left\]

Everyone that develops on the Mac needs some sort of editor. Many swear
by [Coda](http://www.panic.com/coda/ "Panic: Coda"), which I admit is a
good program. The issue with Coda is that it isn't free, and that
doesn't swing it with me. I ended up coming across
[Smultron](http://tuppis.com/smultron/ "Smultron") and I haven't looked
since.

[Smultron](http://tuppis.com/smultron/ "Smultron") offers me everything
I need from a code editor: Snippets, extensible colour coding,
multi-file editing, project support, and automation commands. Now I'll
admit that it doesn't have built-in FTP support, something Coda brags
about, but it does work well with Cyberduck in allowing you to edit
files you open and save them right to the server. This works just fine
for me, though I totally understand the appeal.

Maintenance
-----------

### ClamXav

\[singlepic id=636 w=119 h=119 float=left\]

I'll admit that I've never really had to use
[ClamXav](http://www.clamxav.com/ "ClamXav"). That doesn't make it a bad
product, in fact it's very simple to use. See the issue is that I have
yet to run into a virus that would affect me. Having said that, it's
always good to be prepared, and that's where ClamXav comes in.

Though its interface is far from sexy (nothing like having a giant frame
with your disclaimer in it on the main panel) it does have a feature set
that makes me happy. You can target specific folders for instant
scanning, set up scheduled scans, and have a watch dog-style setup so
that anytime a file is added to specified folders, they're scanned
instantly. Very handy.

### OmniDiskSweeper

\[singlepic id=651 w=119 h=119 float=left\]

This is a very straight-forward program that has one goal: Tell you
where all your Harddrive space has gone. I tend to run this every once
in a while when I notice my hard drive space tanking out, and I cannot
figure out where all of the space is being used.

Now
[OmniDiskSweeper](http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnidisksweeper/ "The Omni Group: OmniDiskSweeper")
isn't a big program, nor is it all that impressive, graphically. It
does, however do it's job perfectly. It scans through your computer and
lists off the main folders and the total size that they take up. From
there you can drill down into the folders and find out what,
specifically, is eating up all of your hard drive space.

### OnyX

\[singlepic id=643 w=119 h=119 float=left\]

I love
[OnyX](http://www.titanium.free.fr/pgs2/english/onyx_leopard.html "Titanium Software: Onyx").
It is pretty much your one stop shop for every day MacBook maintenance,
tweaking, and general upkeep. Hell it even allows you to access
functionality that would require you to operate a couple of programs.

It verifies your startup disk and file structure, it can run general
system maintenance scripts, it can configure hidden parameters for
things like Finder, Doc, Dashboard, ExposÃ©, Safari, the Login window,
and more. It can delete caches, it can clean out logs and files. It also
cuts Julianne fries (no it doesn't).

Basically, if there's something you want to adjust to your MacBook's
settings, run maintenance scripts (I didn't even know the MacBook *had*
maintenance scripts), and generally do some spring cleaning,
[OnyX](http://www.titanium.free.fr/pgs2/english/onyx_leopard.html "Titanium Software: Onyx")
is your best choice.

### XSlimmer\*

\[singlepic id=649 w=119 h=119 float=left\]

This is the only program I've paid for in this entire list - hence the
"mostly" in the title. To that end,
[Xslimmer](http://www.xslimmer.com/ "XSlimmer") is so worth it's money
that not buying it is just silly.

[Xslimmer](http://www.xslimmer.com/ "XSlimmer") basically saves your
computer from having to store binaries of code that aren't required.
Universal installers are compiled to run on either the new chipset or
the old one. This requires you to have twice the amount of code stored
in your app in order for it to work across the board. This is a
fantastic idea for developers, but for those of us who only install and
use the product, it takes up twice as much room as it needs to.

This is where [Xslimmer](http://www.xslimmer.com/ "XSlimmer") comes in.

[Xslimmer](http://www.xslimmer.com/ "XSlimmer") is quite literally a
program slimming utility. You can either select programs for it to
attempt to slim, or run the Genie, and have it list all of the products
that you have installed to see what can be slimmed. It has a built in
blacklist you can update to help it know what programs don't operate
properly when slimmed. You are also given the option to install programs
"pre-slimmed" meaning that you drop the app into XSlimmer, and it will
slim it down before installing it to your system.

It has backup and restore functionality as well, so if you slim a
program and everything borks, you can restore the previous version of
the code without any terrible aftermath. XSlimmer also allows you to
report any programs that should be blacklisted, allowing you to
contribute to the community!

I am pretty sure I saved roughly 6 gigs of memory from running XSlimmer
the first time, but I can't remember. I do recall that it was some
obtusely large number though, and that makes Corey happy... and talk in
the third-person.

Utilities
---------

### Burn

\[singlepic id=635 w=119 h=119 float=left\]

I recently had to make a couple copies of CDs for [the place I am
working
at](http://www.mohawkcollege.ca/ "Mohawk College of Applied Arts") over
the summer. Now as far as I can tell, the MacBook only comes with the
"Burn Folder" which is all well and good if you're doing a data cd. But
what If I have to make a copy of an instructional video for a class, and
I can't keep the original?

[Burn](http://burn-osx.sourceforge.net/Pages/English/home.html "Burn")
comes to the rescue!

Burn is a painfully simple burning program that allows users to backup,
burn, or make copies of CDs and DVDs. What I really liked is that when
you back them up, it allows you to make a backup as a mountable hard
drive. This means that you can actually emulate the CD/DVD from your
desktop should the need arise.

Amazingly simple, yet surprisingly powerful. Now I don't know how it
would handle copy-written material, but that's not something I generally
use my Mac for anyways.

### smcFanControl

\[singlepic id=650 w=119 h=119 float=left\]

[smcFanControl](http://www.eidac.de/?cat=40 "eidac: smcFanControl") is
one of those programs that you kind of wonder why it had to be made in
the first place. I mean really, I shouldn't have to download a program
in order to tell my computers fan(s)
"ohgodtoohotburninglapcoolthisthingdownmoreitburns" but sadly, that does
seem to be the case.

[smcFanControl](http://www.eidac.de/?cat=40 "eidac: smcFanControl") is a
tiny app that sits in your menu bar, and allows you to change the
current RPM of your fans on a whim. You can create your own settings for
quick swapping (I have Default, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, MAX) and even
has MacBook Pro support so that you can control your fans separately.
It's free, it's tiny, and it's saved my computer from melting while
running intense Photoshop sessions. A total must-have.

### Cyberduck

\[singlepic id=637 w=119 h=119 float=left\]

I used to use [OneButton](http://onebutton.org/ "OneButton FTP") FTP,
which I still think is a fantastic program. But when I moved servers, I
had to change FTP clients because OneButton does not support SFTP or
some other advanced connection options. So I went hunting around and
eventually got my hands on
[Cyberduck](http://cyberduck.ch/ "Cyberduck").

[Cyberduck](http://cyberduck.ch/ "Cyberduck") does everything you expect
it to do, and that's pretty much it. It's simple to use, easy to
navigate, and can even detect local servers to connect to (a la Bonjour
devices). It supports opening documents directly from FTP and saving
back to, which is always nice. I'm not sure how common that is in FTP
programs, but there it is.

It does everything the big, costly FTP apps do, but it's free.

Oh, and there's a widget that you can get with it to quick-upload things
from your dashboard. So that's handy.

### FontExplorer X

\[singlepic id=640 w=119 h=119 float=left\]

Made by Linotype, [FontExplorer
X](http://www.fontexplorerx.com/ "LinoType: FontExplorerX") is a great
way to quickly access, activate, deactivate, and test your fonts out.
You can tell it where to install fonts (like the normal spot, or
wherever you want them to go), you can organize them according to
labels, and even have sets and smart sets.

Basically FontExplorer X has all of the features that Finder has for
normal files, but for your fonts. Conveniently, FontExplorer X has the
ability to buy fonts and download them direct from LinoType (much like
iTunes).

All in all, it's actually a very smooth process, and for those in the
graphic design business, or for those new to it, FontExplorer X is a
God-send.

***UPDATE**:* Apparently this one is still
[downloadable](http://www.fontexplorerx.com/download/ "LinoType: FontExplorerX"),
but no longer supported. I still recommend getting it while you can. You
can always pay for the pro version, but once again: ***money***.

### DropBox

\[singlepic id=638 w=119 h=119 float=left\]

I really don't know how much more I can really talk about
[DropBox](/2009/01/19/technology-that-works-dropbox/ "Corey Dutson: Technology that works - DropBox").
I have boasted it's pure sex functional experience
[before](/2009/01/19/technology-that-works-dropbox/ "Corey Dutson: Technology that works - DropBox").

I don't think I need to get on my soapbox again, but let me say this:
It's a backup system that is simple to use, easy to install, and works.
What more do I have to say that I haven't said before?

[Get it.](http://www.getdropbox.com "DropBox")

### Senuti

\[singlepic id=644 w=119 h=119 float=left\]

I've only had to use this once, and that was only because I had to
migrate all of my music that I had on my iPod. Now I know you can pull
off the music from your iPod by making it act like a drive - blah blah
blah - but when you do that, the file names are still encoded by the
madness that the iPod runs off of. So what do you do if you need to get
your music off of your iPod? iTunes won't do it, so you have to go
somewhere else.

[Senuti](http://www.fadingred.com/senuti/ "Senuti") is one of those
solutions.

It's fairly straight-forward, and does what it says it does. Plug in
your iPod, select what you want to transfer, and you click the Transfer
button. You're asked where you want to save said files, and then it
goes. Simple, to the point, no annoying setup times.

***UPDATE:*** Apparently it's not exactly free anymore, which is a
damned shame. Still, if you only need to use it once (like I did) the
trial will do you just fine.

### Transmission

\[singlepic id=647 w=119 h=119 float=left\]

Not much to say about
[Transmission](http://www.transmissionbt.com/ "Transmission"): it's
probably the easiest and best torrent program you can use for the Mac.
Granted I don't really download things often, especially on my Mac, but
when I do have to Transmission makes it as simple as possible.

It's got a clean interface (the most recent upgrade has improved it even
more-so). If you're in the habit of downloading **legitimate**,
**non-illegal** files using torrents, Transmission is the way to go.

See what I did there?

### VirtualBox

\[singlepic id=648 w=119 h=119 float=left\]

I heart [VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org/ "VirtualBox"). I don't
even need to run it all that often, but I still love it. As I use a Mac,
it is generally thought that I cannot run any Windows applications
because Microsoft and Mac don't play well together. Well with the new
Mac software, you can do a dual-boot into Windows. This is all well and
good, but most people don't want to have to reboot their computer in
order to run Windows.

This has lead to programs such as
[Parallels](http://www.parallels.com/ "Parallels"),
[Coherence](http://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/features/coherence/ "Coherence"),
and [Fusion](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/ "Fusion"). The issue
with all of *these* solutions is that they cost money. I'll admit that
they all work well and are probably worth every penny. I, however,
prefer not spending money when possible. This of course has lead me to
[VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org/ "VirtualBox").

[VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org/ "VirtualBox") works by creating
a sandbox environment for your new operating system. It's sort of like
picture in picture, with your Windows (or Ubuntu, or whatever) build
running in a window. What really makes VirtualBox shine is that a) you
can full-screen the environment making you "feel" like your in windows,
b) you can make network drives to folders in your Mac (allowing you to
share files between builds), and c) you can customize the beejeezus out
of your box. How much RAM you want, what ports are enabled,
localization, everything.

If you're looking for a way to run your install of Windows on a Mac, and
don't have any more money because you spent it all on your install of
Windows, then make sure to check out
[VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org/ "VirtualBox").

Conclusion
----------

So there you have it, a collection of programs I use on my Mac, and I've
only paid for one of them. I think that's a pretty good track record if
I do say so myself. I hope that my quest to not spend money for programs
will assist you, the reader, in doing much the same.

If you have anything to add to my list, feel free to comment them in
this post.
