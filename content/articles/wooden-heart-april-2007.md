Yet another [Doctor Who new
series](http://www.amazon.ca/Doctor-Who-Wooden-Heart-Adventure/dp/1846072263 "Doctor Who: Wooden Heart")
under my belt, and my first with the newest companion, Martha. Written
by Martin Day, this book did well for what it was, but failed at where I
was hoping it wouldn't. As I have stated before and I must state again
here, the new series for the most part seems to be plagued with a sense
of immense mediocrity. This one, just as the last and the one before
that I have read have all felt *manufactured*, instead of written. They
feel more like failed scripts then they do rich stories that are so
elaborate that they simply can't turn into episodes.

The story takes place on an abandoned space station/ship/thing called
the Castor, where criminals went to be experimented on. The idea was to
fix the inmates by removing the bad thoughts from them. This sadly has
an adverse side-effect and everyone dies. The Doctor and Martha show up
looking to explore, and upon returning to the TARDIS, they find that the
inside of the hull has been converted into a forest. Within this forest
is a village that is being plagued by some unknown force which seems to
be stealing the children in the night. The Doctor and Martha
investigate, only to find things don't add up.

The book seems to be trying to convey the message that the nature of
Good and Evil are not something that is bred into us by living
conditions or parental guidance, but by choice. Though I agree with the
sentiment, the execution was somewhat lacking. Certain points seemed
obvious, others totally left field, and I'm sure at least one [Deus Ex
Machina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_ex_machina "Deus Ex Machina")
was used. Granted it's Doctor Who and the man is Deus Ex Machina in the
flesh, but *come on*.

As I stated previously, this novel felt as if it were cranked out rather
then created as fine literature. I'm not saying its a bad story at all,
as the characters are well written and the story does flow well, but the
heart just isn't in it. The new adventures thus far have all felt to be
surface story and no depth, comparable to the first few episodes of a
new series on TV. The thing is you don't need to establish the Doctors
character anymore, he's had 10 so far. Get to the good bits! Get to the
darkness, to the depth of his being. Get to the force of nature and the
Champion of Time! Don't give me running down corridors and typical evil
creatures. I've read that enough.

Not bad, but not good. Well written and slightly weird but in the end
pretty standard fare.

5/10
