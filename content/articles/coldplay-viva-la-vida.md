There are a slew of hidden/extra tracks depending on what version of
[Viva la
Vida](http://coldplay.fanfire.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/fanfire.woa/wa/product?sourceCode=COLWEB&sku=COLCD001 "Coldplay: Viva la Vida")
you have (buying from iTunes seems to be the best bet... assuming you
pre-ordered it). My version actually has an extra track which is an
acoustic version of Lost! entitled "Lost?" which I find fantastic. Track
five (Lovers in Japan/Reign of Love) is actually two tracks in one, and
there are also two hidden tracks contained within "Yes" , making this a
much fuller album than what one would initially presume.

The best term I can use for this album is 'solid.' From start to finish,
It's actually quite an impressive listen. The music carries a certain
vibe throughout the entire album, which really unifies it into one
extended experience. Their title track, "Viva la Vida" sends shivers
down my spine every time I hear it. [Watching the
video](http://www.coldplay.com/vivavideo1.php "Coldplay: Viva la Vida - Video")
blew my mind as well.

The tracks tend to alternate between harder and softer, but they all
seem to lead into one another with a musical polish that I've not heard
from many albums. Obvious care was put into track ordering, blending,
and final touches. The album still carries that soothing Coldplay feel
that we've all come to know (if not actually love) making every track
sound very "Coldplayish."

Interesting usage of instruments can be found throughout the album,
proving that they aren't just a piano-driven alternative band.. at least
not anymore. Viva la Vida shows a lot more in the ways of
experimentation instrumentally, though not much changes vocally. I'm not
going to say whether that's a good thing or not, because it really
depends on your perception. Personally I wish the vocals had been a bit
more experimental so as to match the album, but I can't complain about
that.

What I *can* complain about (see what I did there?) is Violet Hill. This
was the single debuted in my area (Toronto/London radio stations) and it
was played to hell. As it turns out this is also my least favorite track
on the entire album by a long shot. I can't really place why I dislike
it so much (read: overplaying) but if I had to take a stab at it, it
would probably be the attempt at telling a story in a near-narrative
format. I know they thought they were doing something cool, but the
result just hurts my head. If I could pretend that wasn't on the album
It would make it that much better.

Considering my only real issue with the entire album is one track, I'd
have to say that that give's it a pretty solid score. It's worth
listening to, so long as you're into the alternative scene, or you're
already a fan of Coldplay. If you're as much a fan as I am/was it's
still worth listening to because I can assure you that you'll have some
new favorites to add your your song listing.
