So if anyone at all still vainly checks this, you may or may not have
noticed that seem to have fallen off the face of the planet. This is, of
course, an ignorant assumption because of gravity. It is impossible to
fall off the planet, let alone its face.

I have however been busy with life, being lazy with updating this, and
other lame excuses that I cannot fathom at the moment.

I'm not going to bother with all that because quite honestly I was just
lazy and had no drive to update this site. No real reason, but I'm back
to take another stab at it.

The reason for this is two fold:

1.  Theresa (who I am still with thankfully) is back in school, so I
    once again have too much time on my hands.
2.  I've been feeling somewhat depressed lately, and though I wont get
    into specific reasons as to why, I am wondering if doing this blog
    will help me with/through it.

Worry not faithful readers (all zero of you), I'm not suicidal or emo or
any of that kief, I am simply feeling a little down.

I may as well get back into the swing of things with what I have been
doing for the past... lets say... week. Yes, a week sounds good.

Alright, so I recently finished watching House: Season Three which was,
as usual, amazing. I love that show dearly and I am overly sure that I
will own all the box sets as they come out. On the up side I have
finally caught up to the current running season, so I can actually have
a reason to watch TV again. Granted it's only for an hour every Sunday
but whatever.

I recently picked up the new [DS: Special
edition](http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3161430 "DS: Special Edition")
that comes with Brain Age 2. It cost me a little bit, but I'm glad I
finally have one and when I get the extra scratch I'm going to get my
hands on the [Opera
Browser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS_Browser "Opera Browser")
and possibly some home brewed programs like the WiFi Phone app I've been
linked to. I don't know where the link is at the moment, but if I find
it, I'll post it. I've wanted a DS for a while, and a special edition
was just the ~~excuse~~ happenstance I needed to make the purchase.

I also recently crash-coursed my
[friend](http://www.danielkukwa.com/ "Dopplegangland")in both [Venture
Brothers: Season
2](http://www.adultswim.com/shows/venturebros/ "Venture Brothers: Season 2")
and [Clone High](http://www.clone-high.com/ "Clone High"). He's a big
guy, so it's funny to see him rendered helpless as he struggles for
breath between fits of laughter. Sure he tries to kill me after, but
it's always so worth it.

Second lastly, I got a job Friday and Saturday nights working at The
Revolution night club doing I don't know what yet. My friend Danny
pointed out that I am "fucking crazy" for doing so, and he's probably
not that wrong. I hate the place and the music, but it's a guaranteed
job, and I wanna pay of my car. Shrug, who knows what interesting
stories may come from it all. More on this as it develops.

Lastly, I'm swinging in and out of writing, so we'll see what develops
with that.
