            <p>My feature code was throwing an error today. For those who don't know
what I'm talking about here is a crash course: A feature basically
allows you to attach functionality to something in SharePoint. Maybe you
want to add a menu option to the 'Site Actions' menu, or import some
files into libraries. In my case I wanted to attach functionality to a
specific list. I wrote my feature code, and it seemed fine. Deployed and
activated just great.</p>
<p>Then I tried to create a Custom List. I had event receivers attached to
custom lists (ListTemplateID=100 for those who care) and i got this:</p>
<p><em>Cannot insert the value NULL into column 'Name', table
'[somesharepointcontentdatabase].dbo.EventReceivers';<br />

at work today. As I have previously stated, I work with

Much of the time I am branding it (though not in my current project!)
and so I have a rather intimate and abusive relationship with the
program. I find myself constantly finding weird styling quirks put into
the environment that prove that SharePoint was built by a large group of
people.</p>
<p>There are many instances within SharePoint - and I'm sure within
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepointtechnology/FX100503841033.aspx" title="Microsoft WSS 3,0">WSS</a>
as well - where certain styles that should be consistent end up being
done completely different ways. I wish I had a screen shot as an
example, but you'll have to use ...</p>

plethora of examples that I could choose from for the point I will be
making here, but one strikes me as perfect. You see when we developers
started there things were volatile, unstructured, and pretty much a
mess. My now fellow programmers and myself were hired in the wake of a
collection of other developers leaving for one reason or another. We
were also thrust into a project pretty much from the moment we sat in
our chairs.</p>

Library</a>.
For those not in the know, a Wiki Library is part of SharePoint 2007
(not WSS) and allows for some nifty features such as version viewing,
article linking, and... yeah that's pretty much it. It does all of this
pretty well in and of itself. Woe be upon the person (me) who tries to
crack open this walnut of misery.</p>
<p>As it turns out, customizing a Wiki Library to do anything isn't just
difficult, it's not even a chore. It's a goddamn mission of epically
frustrating scale. Let's start off with some over-all items:</p>

            <p>The gist is this: You can tell the browser how to render your web page.
I'm aware that that's how it should be working from the get go, but as
we learned with the IE7 chaos that this is not the case. Microsoft's
solution is a simple meta-tag that you would add to your markup which
would allow your website to tell the browser (IE8) to act like IE7 or
IE6 or whatever version your site looked pretty in. This is great if
you're a lazy markup-writer, or cannot honestly be bothered with
updating your website in any shape, way, or form. I can see the merit,
truly I can. It's a total cop-out with ...</p>

that if you could fill in forms with whatever you wanted, there'd be no
point to them because everyone's address would be something akin to

enterprising people, institutions, and heartless corporations that want
