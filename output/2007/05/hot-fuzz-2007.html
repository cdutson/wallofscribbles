        <p>What happens when you take every SuperCop movie, combine it with
fantastic writing and British humour so dry, you could use it as a
combustible fuel? You get <strong>Hot Fuzz</strong>. I'm still new at this movie
review thing, so I'm going to try to do this as best I can.<br />
This movie is for all intents and purposes, fantastic. It manages to
take skits from every block-busting action movie (Bad Boys 2, Point
Break, Aliens, etc etc) while still retaining its own identity, brought
about by brilliant writing.</p>
<p>The story, briefly , is that Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is a
super cop, who is outshining the rest of the force. As a result, the
higher-ups whisk him off to Somerset, a village that has won the
"Perfect Village" Award I don't know how many times. Nicholas starts
going mad until a series of "accidents" have him struck paranoid. The
movie then turns into a whodunit for at least an hour as he and his
partner Danny Butterman (Nick Frost) try and figure out what is really
happening. The end of the movie turns out to be a non-stop action ride,
filled with so many near over-the-top items that it just borders on
ludicrous but never quite crossing the line.</p>
<!--adsense#coreysitebanner-->

<p>I was happily enamored with the movie the
entire way through, and never actually became tired with it. I've seen
the movie twice (once with Theresa and again with my brother and his
ladyfolk), and I still found it funny the second time through. I could
even argue that I appreciated the movie more the second time, as I got
to catch all the jokes that flew past me the first time. I kid you not
when I say there is in some instances, 10 jokes under the span of a
minute, and if you miss one and try and think about it you will
undoubtedly miss the rest that proceeded it.</p>
<p>Having said all that, do <em>not</em> see this movie if you are expecting a
movie that is all action and takes itself serious. Don't get me wrong,
it does take itself seriously, but with so many jokes thrown in that it
doesn't give off the feel. Do not see this movie if you are a fan of
cheap laughs and/or gags. Hot Fuzz is British humour right down to its
Limey bones, and can only be appreciated as such.</p>
<p>If you enjoy dry, dark, sarcastic humour. If you like ridiculous fight
scenes in model villages (another movie spoofing), Gun-toting primary
school teachers, and watching an old woman get kicked in the face by
Simon Pegg (truly this is much, MUCH funnier then it sounds). And if and
only if you like listening to old men that you cannot in all honesty
understand until you've watched the movie twice, despite everything they
are saying is rude and humourous, should you watch this movie.</p>
<p>Well okay, if you also enjoy a solid storyline that actually keeps you
guessing, excellent locational shooting, a surprisingly good musical
score, and perfect role casting, then you may want to take a gander at
the movie as well.</p>
<p>Final score: 8/10</p>
