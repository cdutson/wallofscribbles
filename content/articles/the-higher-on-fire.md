\*\*Clear Favorites

This cd has a lot of hip-hop influence, no matter how much the band may
or may not deny it. At least three tracks have clap tracks, and more
then one has what I call "thug beat." I'm not saying these are totally
horrible traits as it is nice to see a better mix of the genr√©s then
Fall Out Boys last
[*thing*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FcBnaLjxY4 "This ain't a scene, its an arms race").
I don't know how many times I could listen to this CD before getting
utterly sick of it but I'm getting a real kick out of it. It's like
listening to the light rock station, but with some pop punk emo..
something blended in.

I have to give special mention to the last track of this album: *Pace
Yourself (Patrick Strump Remix)*. The first track is a fairly typical
remix, but my god, if you keep listening for the "hidden" track... well
that's where it truly shines. I cannot explain how much of the *boyband*
aspect I was talking about shows through on this track. It's totally and
completely a perverse *boyband* song. with Lyrics such as "I'd rather
make you come than go" and "as I shed off every other inch of your
clothes" it is easily one of the dirtiest tracks on my iPod. It's not
blatantly smutty, but it's just so dirty. It's fantastic.

It's a fun album to listen to, and worth listening to at least once, if
only to pick your favorite tracks out. It's got something for everyone.

8/10
