The first thing to note is that Mr. Brooks varies his writing style to
give each story a life of its own. No two narrators sounded alike, which
I have to admit was an impressive thing to behold. The second, and
easily the more important of the two, things to note is that the stories
for the most part managed to move me.

Considering the entire book is a work of fiction, Brooks managed rather
well to make it feel very real. What's more is that he managed to make
it feel very *human*. few authors can truly say the same.

An impressive read over all,

8.5/10
