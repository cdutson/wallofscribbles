            <p>I'm quickly becoming a big fan of <a href="http://www.doublefine.com/" title="Double Fine">Double Fine
Productions</a>, and the
wonderful stuff that's coming wonderfully out of their wonderful hands.
I didn't get a chance to review <a href="http://www.costumequestgame.com/" title="Costume Quest">Costume
Quest</a> when it came
out (by which I mean I was too goddamned lazy) but I can say that it was
easily one of the best Xbox Arcade games to come out in forever.</p>
<p>When the expansion for Costume Quest came out, I burned through it and
found that Double Fine threw in an easter egg/achievement that
advertised their new game (and subject of this review),
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/stackingvideogame" title="Facebook - Stacking">Stacking</a>.</p>
<p>With some interesting mechanics, and the Double Fine sense of humour,
Stacking makes for an interesting addition to the ...</p>

I am a complete fanboy when it comes to what I call "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_Attorney" title="Wikipedia: Ace Attorney">The Lawyer
Games</a>."
This catchall title is used when talking about any of the Phoenix Wright
or Apollo Justice games. I've talked about

of the series, and so now that I find myself with a little time
(shockingly) I thought that I should probably get off my ass and get to
writing! Self-deprecating aside, I've always enjoyed the Ace Attorney
series, but I honestly found this one to be a little lost. Well, a
little lost until the end when the grand machinations of the writers
come to fruition.</p>

went and saw it with Theresa when It came out in Canada (October 3rd, if
anyone is wondering). We had seen previews for it months ago, and the
idea intregued us both. At that point it fell off the map to anyone who
wasn't actively trying to follow it.</p>
<p>Apparently it was shown at the Cannes film festival to mixed reception.
Reading reviews online does little to ease ones trepidation towards the
film. It seems that Blindness is a movie that has those who love it, and
others that feel that it was "<span class="story_body"><a href="http://www.filmthreat.com/index.php?section=reviews&amp;Id=11233" title="Blindness: reviewed">like looking

            <p>The concept of the book is pretty straight forward: Nameless asshole guy
goes throughout his life, and it's narrated in first person so you get
all of his thoughts as they go. You also get to read about his having
sex, wanting to have sex, jerking off, wishing to jerk off, or some sort
of combination of all the previous activities for about 60% of the book.
This may sound like a pathetic excuse for a novel, but if you take all
the satire out of it, you will realize that guys think about sex on a
near-unhealthy amount. The narrator continues to document his life and
lusts as his relationship falls apart around him and a new one ...</p>
