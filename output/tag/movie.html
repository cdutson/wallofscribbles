            <p>Lars (Ryan Gosling) is a recluse who, as recluses tend to do, hides
himself from the world. He shuns the advances of a girl from work (Kelli
Garner), and avoids any sort of situation (i.e., breakfast) with anyone.
After a bit of a confrontation with his sister-in-law (Emily Mortimer),
he gets a Real Doll, Bianca, from the web and claims he "met her on the
internet". She is wheelchair-bound, but very sweet. Lars treats her like
she's completely real and the town decides to go along with it to help
Lars through whatever psychological delusion he is having. As a result
the whole town bonds with Bianca, and helps Lars come to terms with how
the world works ...</p>

            <p>Over the Christmas holidays, Theresa and I went to our local
<a href="http://www.princesscinemas.com/" title="Princess Cincemas">independent movie
theater</a>, and
watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0467406/" title="Juno">Juno</a>. I have to
say that it's easily one of the best films I watched in 2007. It was
sweet, funny, and potent in all the right spots.</p>
<p>The movie Juno is about one Juno MacGuff (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0680983/" title="Ellen Page">Ellen
Page</a>) and Paulie
Bleeker (the ever master of awkward pauses, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0148418/" title="Michael Cera">Michael
Cera</a>) and their
joint child-making. The movie takes place during the nine months of
Juno's wonderful adventure through pregnancy, and her interaction with
the adoptive couple Vanessa and Mark Loring (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004950/" title="Jennifer Garner">Jennifer
Garner</a> and

            <p>Beowulf is the newest adaptation do the epic poem of yore. It's rather
liberal with its interpretation, and as near as I can tell, also adds
new and unrelated sections to the plot.</p>

I am sorry to everyone who was around me who was also trying to watch
the movie seriously. I didn't mean to laugh at it so much, I really
didn't! But when a man is naked for over half of the film, has
questionable (at best) dialog, and so much over the top fighting that a

            <p>Much of the movie revolves around the Vietnam War, and the protests that
went on during the time. All the characters are pulled into differing
sub-cultures and left to their own devices, and are let to play out
their lives with what they've gotten themselves into. It demonstrates
what people are capable of when they feel the need to work for
something. It displays people in their best and worst moments without
much in the ways of compromise, and shows that people aren't perfect nor
do situations always work out glowing. It does glaze over one or two
areas that probably could have had more explaining, but you cannot
realize this during the film and it probably isn ...</p>

watch this movie at about 3 in the morning after Theresa suffered a
horrible coughing fit (she developed a cough while at school). She
decided to put a movie on since she has this amazing habit to fall
asleep to any movie she sets her mind to. I sadly do not have the same
ability. In fact I could go so far as to say that if a movie is being
played, I'll be drawn to it like a moth to the flame, regardless of the
quality of the movie. All it takes is one hook and it's over.</p>

            <p>On the weekend I went out with Theresa and four others (sister, roomie,
and the boyfriends) to one of the only things to do in North Bay. You
really only get four options: Drink, have sex, go to the mall, or go to
the movies. Well you can mix and match those, but that's basically it.
Regardless, we went to the movies.</p>
<p>This is where I saw Good Luck Chuck.</p>
<p>Now I've heard people saying that either it was good, or it sucked
dirty, smelly anus. The bell curve for this movie and the people who
watched it vs people who liked it leans towards people whom I tend to
agree with. This was not a good movie ...</p>
