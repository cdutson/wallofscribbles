I've [strung words together before]({filename}../Game reviews/professor-layton-and-the-curious-village-level-5-2008.md "Corey Dutson: Professor Layton and the Curious Village")
about my issue with brain-teasers. I'm sad to say that things have not
improved *at all*. I still get hung up on them, I still lose sleep over
them, and I still allow them to consume me far too much. It's a
character flaw on my part, and I've learned to live with it. So what do
you think would happen if say, another Professor Layton were to come
out?

Yeah, I didn't really stand a chance.



Synopsis
--------

So the story of [Professor Layon and the Diabolical Box](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B002AU0HZQ?ie=UTF8&tag=walofscr-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B002AU0HZQ "Amazon.co.uk - Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box")
starts off pretty much where we ended last time. I assume no more than a
month has passed between stories. This isn't important, I'm just giving
context here.

Anyways, the Professor and Luke are sent a message from one of the
Professors old friends. Said letter contains the friend's ramblings
about getting his hands on something called the Elysian Box. This box is
said to kill any person who opens it. Of course the friend opened said
box, and no one has heard from him since.

The Professor and Luke go to investigate, where the find their friend
prone on the ground. After some additional investigation, the Professor
and Luke make for an elaborate train that their old friend had a ticket
to. The story gets decidedly more messed up from that point on.

Oh and of course you are solving puzzles pretty much from the get go.



Mechanics
---------

Very little has changed, in terms of basic game mechanics. You still tap
your way around the map looking for hidden Hint Coins (a currency used
to buy hints to puzzles that have you flummoxed) and hidden puzzles. You
have to solve puzzles to progress throughout the story, and there are
points when you need to solve a certain amount of puzzles in order to
progress.

There are three mini-games built in which I shall quickly go over:

-   Broken Camera: Within the story you are given the task of repairing
    a camera. This involves finding the pieces, and then assembling them
    all so that everything fits within the frame of the camera. This
    isn't as hard as you'd think so long as you look at it practically.
    The flash goes in the flash area, the plunger goes in the plunger
    area, and the lens goes in the lens area.Once you have built the
    camera, you can take photos of certain areas and have a most
    fun/infuriating time spotting the three differences between them.
    Succeeding in this usually results in being able to find yourself a
    hidden puzzle.
-   Fat Hamster: You are given the task of getting a rather obnoxious
    and impressively obese hamster into shape. You are given a selection
    of hamster toys throughout the story which you can use to make the
    hamster run to. Getting him to run to enough things, lowers
    his weight. When you get him to a rank of 0 (in shape) he returns
    the favor by obnoxiously pointing out the location of hidden coins
    on the screens your traverse.
-   Magic Tea Set: The magic tea set is given to you by an old woman
    after completing a set of puzzles from her. The idea of the tea set
    is to create 12 teas using a variety of ingredients that you pick up
    along your travels. But what is the point of making tea if not to
    share them with people?This comes to the second part of the game:
    helping others. Throughout the game, you will come across people who
    appear to be sweating. Approaching them at this point will give you
    a dialogue where you have to give them a tea that will meet
    their requirements. This can be a total pain in the ass if you screw
    up, because you'll have to go back and forth to that screen until
    they're sweating again so that you can have another shot.

Other than that, the game plays out pretty much identically as the
previous installment. The puzzles will ask you to circle, draw lines, or
input a number. Or slide things. Lets not forget the God-forsaken slider
puzzles. There are enough of those to make you hate your life, I can
assure you.

Oh, and yes, there are secret doors in the Bonus puzzle rooms. No I have
not opened any because my girlfriend happened to save over my completed
game from the first game. That means no code which means no secret doors
for me. I know what's behind them, but I'm not telling.

Words from the Wise
-------------------

There isn't really too much I can give in terms of advice. I'm not going
to answer any riddles here, so if you're looking for those, you'll have
to try somewhere else. Having said that, here are some things you can do
to make your life a little easier.

-   ***Tap everywhere***. You never know where puzzles or hint coins
    are located. The hamster won't show up every time, so be thorough.
    Beyond that, the hamster won't point out puzzles, so you'll have to
    scrounge for those yourself.
-   ***Think hard before you answer***. I can't tell you how many times
    I lost points because I was impulsive with my answer. Just take a
    beat and think about your answer before you click that
    submit button.
-   ***Don't be afraid to use hint coins***. They're there for a reason.
    Sure you may want to man through it and not use any, but that
    doesn't make your awesome, it wastes your time on stupid puzzles
    that could be solved much quicker if you just took a hint.
-   ***Don't feel bad about cheating***. I did it, and I don't feel bad.
    There are some puzzles that will blow your mind way open, and as
    such it will simply be beyond you to answer them. I cheated on most
    of the sliding puzzles, and one or two math ones. I don't feel bad
    because after putting in 1000+ moves into each slider puzzle, I
    decided to bow out and let the Internet guide me. As for the math
    questions? Well when you have to make a Quadratic Equation just to
    figure something out? *Go fuck yourself*. I signed up for riddles,
    not math.



Overall
-------

The writing, voice acting, and overall story was fantastically. The
puzzles were, overall, enjoyable and gave my brain a workout. Having
said that, slider puzzles and complex math questions can all go die in a
fire. I'm aware that they're concepts and cannot die in a physical fire.
I can still wish for the concepts to die in a conceptual fire. Other
than those, the rest of the puzzles were pretty solid.

The music was well done. Hell I'd go so far as to say that the music in
this one was far better than the last game. The artwork was top notch,
and it translated perfectly into the videos. Even the CG used in the
videos was some of the best I've seen when blending CG and animation.

The story was odd, border-line cryptic, and had all the little details
that really made the story come together. If you can take the extra time
to talk to everyone in the game, you'll get a much better understanding
of what's going on and gain a much better understanding of the depth to
which the writers actually went.

All in all, it's an enjoy able game and it's a good way to kill 30 hours
of time.

8/10
