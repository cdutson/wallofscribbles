This album is a clear advancement from the
[first](http://www.amazon.com/Sunsets-Car-Crashes-Spill-Canvas/dp/B0001KBP30/ref=pd_sim_m_shvl_img_1/002-8566816-1375207 "Sunsets and Car Crashes")
[two](http://www.amazon.com/One-Fell-Swoop-Spill-Canvas/dp/B000A2H88U/ref=pd_sim_m_shvl_img_2/002-8566816-1375207 "One Fell Swoop")
(that I've heard. I need to get my hands on Go For the Jugular and The
Concept EP) in terms of sound and meaning. It's somewhat interesting to
listen to them all in a row, since you can pretend to see how the
singers life generally went. In the first album, he was young and so in
love that it hurt. In the second album he was dumped horribly and went
into a depression spiral. He seem that way the first time I saw them in
concert. Then the
[EP](http://www.amazon.com/Denial-Feels-Good-Spill-Canvas/dp/B000OYC7AI "EP: Denial Feels So Good")
came out and he found someone else that was hot as hell. He seemed
*that* way the third time I saw them (around the same time the EP was
coming out). With this new installment, it seems like he finally got his
shit figured out and is a damaged but stable person. I'm just
speculating here, so don't quote. It was just funny to speculate.

Anyways, this album has more favorite tracks on it than any of the
previous ones, and I'm trying to place exactly why. Maybe it's because
the music has grown up a little, and myself with it. Maybe it's the fact
that they've cleaned up the sound a lot and it seems there is a lot more
composition effort put forth by the entire band. The guitar in
particular seems to be a bit more intricate then either of the previous
albums.

On the flip side to all of this is the fact that the songs do not, for
the most part, seem as personal as the previous ones, even the remake of
*Appreciation* (renamed to Appreciate and the Bomb) doesn't seem as
strong as its EP counterpart. Maybe that's what I meant when I said they
were getting more mainstream sounding. You lose a bit of the heart when
you try to sell more records. Maybe they're actually not as depressed
now, and instead of being hypocritical, they're actually writing happier
stuff. I don't know for sure, and I don't really care.

It's a good album, but the best from them I don't think. I love lots of
tracks on this CD, but it just doesn't "do" it for me. I like those
tracks individually, but I don't know if I can listen to the whole CD
more then maybe twice before I start skipping tracks and abusing my
favorites. Worth listening to, even worth owning (if only to support the
band). I'll stand firm and say that their EP is their best all around
album. I can listen to that on repeat till forever.

7/10
