The piano and drums are featured heavily throughout the tracks, though I
use 'heavily' in a loose sense. What I mean to say is they are the
featured instruments throughout their debut album. The whole thing tends
to remind me of a
[cyberpunk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk "cyberpunk") film
n√≥ir (someone tell me if I used the wrong character there) Adding to the
point is the fact that many of the tracks don't even feature singing;
they're purely instrumental.

One thing that can start to grate on you is the fact that the singer
sounds the exact same in every song where he *does* sing. Some people
may not mind or even notice this, but for people like me who have a
horrible habit of skipping artists for variation... well it gets sort of
old. Like I said, you need to be in the mood to listen to this one.

As an aside, I almost favorite-ed the second track "Typical" as it is a
fairly solid track but ironically, I found it rather typical-sounding in
and of itself. It's a good track, but just didn't make the cut for me.

It's a fairly laid-back album and you really need to be in the mood to
listen to it. I suggest either driving your car around metropoli (what
the hell is the multiple for metropolis?) in car commercials, or when
you otherwise need to be very calm and reflective. I'm glad I have the
album, but only for certain tracks. Hell, three don't even qualify as
tracks in my book. Being all under 1:30 they're just long interludes as
far as I'm concerned.
