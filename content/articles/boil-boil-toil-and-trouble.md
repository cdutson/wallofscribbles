In actuality, the phrase is "Double, double, toil and trouble; Fire
burn, and cauldron bubble." but whatever, I'm exercising my right to
artistic license. Fuck you Shakespeare. Before I forget, as I am wont to
do on the days I work late at work (they still happen, though far less
frequent) I wish a safe and happy All Hallows Eve to everyone... even
though there is roughly half an hour left to the date in question.

So yes, I was at work late today, and will be tomorrow so that we can
have a pimped-out demo of something for our client. What I'm doing
shouldn't be as hard as it is, and yet somehow it's proven to be a dick
pretty much from the get go. I won't go into details, but let me just
say that dynamic controls and saving state is a bitch, pure and true.
Seriously, What the hell is wrong with ViewState sometimes.

Taylor and I happened to go to the [2007 Casby
Awards](http://www.edge.ca/station/video_gallery.cfm "http://www.edge.ca/casbys/2007.cfm")
last Wednesday. It was fun and loud, but we got to see a couple
[good](http://www.matthewgood.org/ "Matthew Good")[artists](http://www.rainemaida.net/ "Raine Maida")
play. I am sad that I didn't get a chance to see [Raine
Maida](http://www.rainemaida.net/ "Raine Maida") busking on the streets
of Toronto the following day though. In any case, I nabbed the tickets
through 102.1 The Edge's Wha Happn Content, and you can view my sad
entry
[here](http://www.edge.ca/contests/wha_happened_gallery.cfm?rem=87663&jor=87663#video "Stupid Corey").
It's not dirty or anything, just ... really really stupid of me. I
really earned the messed up ankle I now live with. After watching the
video I have realized that I bob my head when story telling. I bot it a
*lot*. I wonder if it has any effect on the reception.



I'm almost done [Phoenix Wright: Ace
Attorney](http://www.capcom.com/phoenixwright/ "Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney")
. This last case literally takes as long as every other case put
together; It's damned near perpetual! I'm on the last court date and
soon I will destroy (in lawerly ways) the guilty and redeem the
innocent. I'll object their wrong-doing asses into the dirt. Following
that I'll be able to post my first video game review, so I'm looking
forward to that. I'm still trying to get more content onto the site that
can actually benefit people other than me. I can only hope that I've
been managing that thus far. I've decided on a schedule of Monday,
Wednesday, Friday, with possible bonus posting thrown in during the
weekend. I figure that it's good practice for me to really adhere to a
schedule, as well as help my writing ability. Gotta get the creative
juices flowing one way or the other.

I finally start work at The Rev this coming Friday. I don't know if I
should be excited for it or not. It's a new job and a new experience and
so in that respect I should be looking forward to it. On the flip side
It's bar running/busing tables at The Rev. I don't even like the music
they play. The reason I took this job is pretty much because it pays
well, It's something different, and someone pretty much hooked me up
with the job. How could I say no? The real downside is that its a 10-3
am sort of deal, so my sleep schedules going to get messed right up.
Still, if it gets to hard I can always walk away from it.

I've also started reading *[Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked
Witch of the
West](http://www.amazon.com/Wicked-Life-Times-Witch-West/dp/0060987103 "Wicked")*.
I've wanted to read it since I first saw the book, but I forgot about it
for a hell of a long time, and I've only just gotten to it. So far it's
not a bad book, but I've only cleared the first 60 or so pages and so my
judgments will have to wait a little longer. I hope it doesn't suck
though, it's 550 pages.

As I stated previously, I'm working on getting some more article-y stuff
into the site, and I'm trying to expand into more then just reviewing
four different genrÃ©s (Video, Music, Games, Books). I'm going to work on
possibly getting technology and design articles up that I find
interesting. I hope that if nothing else I can provide information to
others that can actually assist them in their day to day workings.

In any case, stay tuned for more articles as they develop, I'm hoping to
get that Phoenix Wright one out sometime this weekend (assuming I have
the time to play and finish the damned game) as well as whatever the
hell else I can dig up. Right now is sleep time though. I'm beat from
work.

Happy Halloween people!
