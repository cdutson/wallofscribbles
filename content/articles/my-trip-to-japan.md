This post is coming to you at least <span
style="text-decoration: line-through;">two</span> three months late, but
hey, for at least one of those months I was rather busy with school. I
don't really have an excuse for the latter, but that's just how it is.

Anyways, back in March, I was given a fantastic opportunity to visit
Japan via a friend of mine. Given that it was a trip to frikkin' Japan,
I couldn't possibly have said no. Had I known how long the flight was
actually going to feel, I might have reconsidered. Going there took
somewhere around 18 hours and coming back took almost 24. There's
nothing quite like an 8 hour layover to make you consider killing
yourself and/or those around you.

Thankfully the Detroit International Airport has a fantastic massage
parlor. Best 30 dollars I have ever spent.

I will also apologize in advance for the load of this page. I've got a
bunch of photos in this one, so if it takes a while to load... well
you'll have to wait i guess! I'm going to note the numbers of the photos
from [my
flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/corey_dutson/sets/72157617132788232/ "Flickr.com: Corey Dutson - Japan 2009")
just so you can sort of follow along.

In case you are too lazy to [visit my flickr
set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/corey_dutson/sets/72157617132788232/ "Flickr.com: Corey Dutson - Japan 2009"),
you can [jump to the end of the post](#photoGal "Photo Gallery"), where
I have a lovely flash dohickey that will rotate through all of my
photos.

Getting There (Day One) {#DayOne name="DayOne"}
-----------------------

I didn't really sleep the night before (I think I slept around 2 hours,
and that was a toss-and-turn affair) and by 6 a.m. we were at the
Toronto Pearson airport, and by 9 a.m. we were on our way to Detroit,
where we were given a lovely 2 hour stop over. To Detroit's credit, the
airport is pretty nice. The area we were in was basically a very, very
long tunnel with shops and terminals , but those of
us who can't pass out anywhere - me - ended up wandering around the
terminal, like lost duckings looking for their mother.

I ended up getting a massage, which felt amazing after being on a 10
hour flight. We also ate, and I killed the rest of my DS's battery
sitting around.

Some kid left their camera sitting around, and when they went back for
it, it was missing. We had lost and regained very important things all
week, and within the 8 hours we were in Detroit, a camera was stolen. It
really makes you think about us on a societal scale, doesn't it?

In the End {#InTheEnd name="InTheEnd"}
----------

I loved it in Japan. I'd live there if I could. At the very least I'm
going back there for a longer stay. I encourage any and everyone to go
over there and be amazed at the richness of culture and history that you
can find around every turn. My only wish is that we could have visited
Hiroshima, which another tour group got to do. They were staying longer
though, so it makes sense.

And here are all of the photos from my trip. Enjoy!
