        <p>I had an amazing 20 minutes of utter relaxation at work the other day. I
didn't even realize it until it was nearly over, but I think I've solved
the equation. As it turns out, I think I finally understand why coffee
shops are so damned relaxing.</p>
<p>To achieve coffee shop-level relaxation, you need six things:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>A Comfy Seat</strong><br />
    This is key, you cannot relax without a good, squishy, comfy seat
    to rest your bum on. I don't think anyone can truly relax on a
    stone bench. I'm not saying you can't use a bench, but I doubt you
    will hit your optimal relaxation point.</li>
<li><strong>A Drink</strong><br />
    I'm not sure why but hot drinks tend to work better, even in
    warm weather. Try and get something that is as pleasing to smell as
    it is to taste. I'm a fan of French vanilla or raspberry flavours
    when I'm trying to relax. If you have to get something cold, try and
    something of the slurpy or slushy variety. They are more fulfilling
    to consume.</li>
<li><strong>A Snack</strong><br />
    The snack is pinnacle to the whole system. It has to be something
    you can break apart with one hand, so it has to be smooshy
    or break-up-able. It can't be messy lest you ruin whatever you
    are reading. It also has to compliment whatever you are drinking so
    that you don't get conflicting tastes. My suggestion is a good
    blueberry muffin. Almost everything goes with Blueberry except and
    sort of anti-berry drink such as turpentine.</li>
<li><strong>Something to Read</strong><br />
    A novel or similar one-handed book works best, though I'm sure you
    can still work it with a news paper or larger book. Try and avoid
    anything digital; not only is it harder on the eyes, but I find
    electronics stimulate too much of the brain. Make sure you're
    reading something you are generally interested in. Just because you
    can read the dictionary, doesn't mean you should. If you're into
    that go for it, but I have a suspicion that you don't get invited to
    many parties.</li>
<li><strong>A Table or Or Other Surface to Place Your Stuff</strong><br />
    A table or similar surface is what I'm referring to. If you can get
    it on the side in which all of your non-book items are going,
    even better. The trick is to move as little as needed when going for
    your drink or food. Try and get one at a good hight too. Nothing is
    more annoying then having to reach too far up or down just to get to
    your food.</li>
<li><strong>Ambient or White-Noise in the Background</strong><br />
    This is what really makes the difference. Coffee shops have people
    talking in the background, my work has a server and lots
    of key-clicking. Whatever is your backdrop noise, make sure it's
    mild and pleasant. Try and avoid fast music or anything with a
    pronounced "Thump" beat.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you meet these six conditions, you can actually become exceptionally
relaxed merely by enjoying then in union. I managed to do it, and it's
probably the most relaxed I've been in a while; and at work no less!
You'll know when you're relaxed when everything goes "wuanh." I'm aware
that that was a noise, and not an identifiable one, but when it happens
that's what you'll feel. It's the same sort of feeling when time forgets
about you.</p>
<p>One more thing, remember that you cannot force it. If you try and make
the relaxation happen, it wont. The trick is to get caught up in the
moment, or the book, or both. You'll be relaxing in no time.</p>
