The bases if [The Electric
Church](http://the-electric-church.com/ "The Electric Church - by Jeff Somers")
takes place in a post-unification, 1984-esque world where the entire
earth is ruled by a corrupt bureaucracy, and there is a clear separation
between the upper class and the rest of the world. It's a grungy
Cyberpunk story where no one in the slums should live past the age of
22, everyone drinks tub gin, and bullets are as common as smells.

Our anti-hero, Avery Cates, is a gunner: a gun for higher, assassin, hit
man, or all-around kill-for-cash sort of dude. He's 27 and doesn't know
how he got as far as he did. He's hired by the corrupt upper-class to
stop an up and coming religion: The Electric Church. Rumors have been
spreading that the EC has been forcibly gaining converts, but due to
regulations the SSF (The System Pigs, as they are lovingly referred to)
can't legally do anything about it. They call in Cates to try and
assassinate the head of the EC.

I found it really difficult to get past some of the dialog in this book.
There was simply that much swearing throughout it that I found it hard
at times to actually get into specific scenes. I can understand having
some, or even moderate amounts of swearing, but when you have at least
one a sentence for an entire page, it gets a little old.

Another problem I had was how shallow much of the book really was. There
was a lot of depth put into how crummy the world has become, but very
little is put into those who exist in it. The population of the slums is
described - repeatedly - as "The Gray Masses." I could deal with that,
but even the main characters lacked the depth I usually expect from
them. You had a dude with mental powers, a super tech, the anti-hero,
the smooth criminal, and the git'r dun twins. Honestly they couldn't
have been much more cookie cutter if they tried. Even the antagonists
were straight-forward. Evil bribed cop, sketchy church, The Fuzz, The
Sociopath, the list goes on. Everyone was so... typical, that it really
got to me. The only character development happened near the end of the
book, and it was too little too late for me.

My complaints aside, it was an entertaining read. The internal banter of
Averys' mind put a smirk on my face more often than not. The repeated
idea of "of course this is happening, because my day hasn't hit rock
bottom quite yet" is completely at one in [The Electric
Church](http://the-electric-church.com/ "The Electric Church - by Jeff Somers").
I enjoyed the fact that even as one action scene is toning down, another
one is coming around the corner to kick the bejesus out of Avery.

It's also interesting to read the subtle transformation that Cates has
throughout the book, and though I say I saw it coming, it was still well
done. I also appreciated that by the end of the book, the only thing
driving Cates was spite. It's not often you read about how the main
character is going to finish what they started "just be-fucking-cause."

If you're a fan of the Cyberpunk genr√© and don't want anything too dark
and depressing, this is a pretty good option. It's not the best example
I can think of for Cyberpunk, but it was an enjoyable read. I don't know
if I could do it again simply because of the curse-dense dialog and
shallow development of the characters.

6/10
