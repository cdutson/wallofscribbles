<p>Her father grabs some dirt from the pile, while her mother sobs;

Her mother drops to her knees. The priest is speaking his part, his tone
never wavering. The casket is lowered down, to where it will rest. The
pallbearers carry the casket towards the grave site. A collection of her
friends and family stand around the hole in the ground, silent and
still. The Priest is already there, waiting. The hearse pulls up, and
the doors swing open. Cars start pulling up, first the family car, then
friends and extended family.</p>

            <p>Every once in a while, you are told about a game that sounds just a
little too ridiculous to be true. Just something that's a little too far

that it exists. <a href="http://www.atlus.com/" title="Atlus">Atlus</a> published a game

Japan via a friend of mine. Given that it was a trip to frikkin' Japan,
I couldn't possibly have said no. Had I known how long the flight was

            <p>It's been a while since I've played an honest to God platform game. It's
not my usual bag, as it requires a skill set that is lacking in me.
These games generally consist of accurate timing, good aim, and good
reflexes. These are all things I lack, and so platformers tend to annoy
me to the point of non-playing.</p>
<p>I used to stay as far away from platformers as I could, given that my
ability in them scored somewhere in the negatives. Every time I would
try one, I'd get about 4 levels in, and then start to hate myself. It's
really not a pretty sight. Give me turn-based games and experiences

franchise give so much joy, while sapping someones will to live so

of customization and unit control that up to that point I couldn't have
dared dream of.</p>

hackable government systems. It had a solid story line, an excellent ...</p>

I am a complete fanboy when it comes to what I call "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_Attorney" title="Wikipedia: Ace Attorney">The Lawyer

This catchall title is used when talking about any of the Phoenix Wright

(shockingly) I thought that I should probably get off my ass and get to
writing! Self-deprecating aside, I've always enjoyed the Ace Attorney

little lost until the end when the grand machinations of the writers
come to fruition.</p>
