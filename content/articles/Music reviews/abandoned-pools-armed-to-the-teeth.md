In any case, the music coming through my speakers from this album had a
different-but-same feel as the first one. I've come to the conclusion
that Tommy Walter has a personal beef with societies current bell-curve.
I'm not here to say whether he is right or wrong but I will say that his
music, and each song in themselves, contains strong emotion and focus on
their message(s). In the end, the CD tends to have somewhat of a darker
feel to it, and I'm sure it's safe to say that none of the songs will
really make you feel warm and fuzzy inside. In the end my favorite cut
is "Goodbye Song" which is fantastic through its 6+ minutes of
audible-deliciousnes, and makes finishes the album off on a strong,
solid note.

The music comes through exceptionally layered, and gone are the 1950
public-service voices from the [first
album](http://www.wallofscribbles.com/2007/11/abandoned-pools-humanistic.html "Humanistic").
A new (or at the very least more noticeable) usage if the cello is a
welcome addition to the music, and used well. All the songs have
powerful emotion that can be felt throughout the obvious care given to
(almost) all of the songs, though some of them feel a little unfinished
or at the very least unpolished. If I had to compare this album to its
predecessor I would end up picking the former, though it's a hard
choice. There just seems to be more tracks on Humanistic that do it for
me that Armed to the Teeth just doesn't quite do.

It may be moody and it may be a little dark, but this is a solid album
that you should listen to.

8/10
