I wish I could summarize this book properly, but it seems to be many
stories unfolding in one. There are even stories within stories that are
nothing less than vivid and unnerving. The Doctor goes to investigate
temporal disturbances going on in modern-day Earth only to find The
Master trying to exact revenge upon the Chronovores as well as become a
God by taking control of the same power that sustains those same
Chronovores. The plan goes to hell and a new creature is born: The
Quantum Archangel. Que the epic end-of-everything
multi-verse-cluster-fuck that is the second half of this book.

To be honest, I thought that the book was going to be over when there
were still about 150 pages left. I honestly couldn't see how they could
drag it out any further then it had already been dragged. Mr. Hinton did
a damned fine job of throwing me through a loop and creating a story so
epic, that to render it on TV would require technology not currently in
production, and a budget to match. The alternate realities provided
throughout portions of the book really help to complete the mind-blowing
that starts at that 150 page mark. It's one of the few Doctor Who books
that provide a view of the Doctor as totally at the mercy of something
far greater than himself.

The writing is sold from start to finish, and Craig Hinton does a superb
job of nailing the Doctors third and sixth incarnations, as well as The
Masters. The supporting characters are strong, three-dimensional people
who (in some cases) are good recreations of their former corporeal
selves. There's a strong sense of wit and direction in regards to the
back and forth between the differing characters and I found myself
smirking more than once

This book is the reason that I read and love Doctor Who. The ridiculous
epicness that the Doctor generates is worth it all. The depth of
character that is displayed in these books is what the new series lacks,
and which is why time and time again I am brought back to the older
series. To hell with the youth that they are trying to capture with the
new series; give me the depth I crave!

Worth reading, especially if you like epic stories and even more so if
you've seen The Time Monster and enjoyed it.

8/10
