Shoes.

We all need shoes. Well ok, we don't _need_ shoes, but I think it's safe to say that most of us prefer wearing them while we go about our daily lives (if you prefer not to, well then more power to you). I say this because we've managed to construct a wide array of shoe types, not even accounting for the different sub-styles. We've got dress shoes, skate shoes, safety shoes, cowboy boots, dance shoes, heels, pumps, wedges, sandals, hi-tops, sneakers, running shoes, walking shoes, hiking shoes, wellington boots, thigh-highs, the list doth continue.

What's more, is that not all shoes are created equal. We've all been there: you try some on in the store; they feel good in your 30 second runway-walk to the mirror; you buy them; you spray them; you put them on the next day for a walk, and you end up with a thousand blisters. It's happened to the best of us.

Of course, the opposite is also true. Sometimes you find a shoe that feels like it was sculpted for your feet alone. Walking in them is as close to perfection as it can be without them _actually_ being moulded to the contours of your stompers.

This is an ode to my shoes: They started as the former, and ended life as the latter.

## Before we start

Know what's funny? I actually had this long, meandering story about these shoes. It was an exercise in writing that I set forth for myself. It covered their origins, and then I was going to go into our spotty relationship before lamenting that they were the comfiest shoes I've ever ended up.

I'm sure if you dig through the git history of this file you can read all that, but I couldn't even bring myself to finish it. It's not that it was bad or anything. I know it wasn't pulitzer-winning stuff, but it wasn't, _like,_ terrible.

It was however long-winded and needlessly self-indulgent. So I opted for a total rewrite, and here we are. The following is a far less flowery ode to my brutal-cum-comfy shoes.

## My shoes

I bought my shoes whilst living in England from a store named [Schuh](http://tribulant.net/shoppingcart/product/mens-adidas-culver-mid-trainers/). They were resplendent when I bought them; truly they were beautiful and clean and bright. I bought them while I was still sporting some other Nike hightops that I'm not going to spend the same amount of time looking up.

Seriously, I spent hours tracking these shoes down on the internet. Seriously, like 7 hours. Thankfully a friend of mine, a man much more shoe-headed than myself, tracked them down in about 20 minutes. He's fabulous. Thanks Mark.

Anywho, I bought them for a reasonable price, and then they sat in my home for months before I actually tried em on for a longer stint.

As it turns out, they weren't actually all that comfortable. In fact they really kind of sucked to wear for any long period of time. I tried them out a couple times, and all I got for my effort was blisters. So I threw 'em in the closet and the followed me from home to home until I eventually returned to Canada.

## Shoes in Canada

Since coming back to Canada, I've lost a chunk of disposable income, because it turns out the UK economy and the Canadian economy are vastly different. As a result I haven't been able to do much shoe shopping as I used to.

Well okay, the shoes released for guys in the recent years have been boring, for the most part. The only way to get awesome-looking shoes is through the internet, and I have such troubles buying shoes as it is. So that's another reason I waited so long.

Oh, and I had a [daughter]({filename}../Personal/parenting-is-hard.md). That totally eats away at excess finances. Okay so there were a couple reasons I opted to not refill my shoe stable.

So I did what anyone in my position would do: I wore every other pair of shoes that I owned until they were ready to be tossed. I was eventually left with no other option than to wear these hurting bastards, and wore them I did.

## The beginning of the end

The first day of wearing those shoes was one that found myself walking roughly 4 kilometres in the rain. I didn't really want to do that, but circumstances forced my hand, or foot, as it were. The result of that walk was that my shoes enacted a blood sacrifice from my big toe.

I mean that literally. My toe was so torn up that I've still got a scar there now. However, since my shoes slaked their thirst for blood, they suddenly became the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned. 

Seriously, I have never had shoes that have felt anything near this comfortable in my life. I probably never will again.

So I wore these damned shoes until they were basically unrecognizable. They reached that sort of worn in that street urchins would wear in a play. If street urchins a: still existed; and b: wore Adidas-brand shoes for some bizarre reason. 

I've worn these shoes everywhere. I've worn them to work, on my bike, to dance clubs. I have shopped in them, trekked across cities in them. They have climbed hills and wandered valleys. They've been on mountains and by the ocean. They are stained with a world of experience.

I wore the hell out of these shoes.
	
## Their sendoff

I bought some new shoes (no where near as comfortable or pretty) after my co-workers mocked what I was wearing around my feet. These new ones are fine, but not _the same,_ you know? 

So I did what anyone would probably not do: I took a bunch of photos of them to write a blog post. We all handle loss differently, I guess. So anyways, here's some more photos of my hobo-level shoes for what it's worth.

Good night, sweet shoes. You did good. 

Rest now.
