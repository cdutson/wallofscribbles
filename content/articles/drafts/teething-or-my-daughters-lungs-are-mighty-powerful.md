Nature is an unforgiving force. It forces creatures to adapt or die. Some creatures developed poisons to use as both a protection and a hunting tool; others were given thick skin and mighty claws. On the other end of the coin, if you flip a rabbit onto its back, it will go into a paralytic shock that both looks adorable, and can actually stress the rabbit out until its heart explodes.

Nature doesn't always get it right. 

And lo, I say unto you, dear reader(s): Teething is very, very stupid, and if nature could feel bad about it, it damned well should.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

I didn't think this website would become a sounding board for my musings as a parent, but someone somewhere once said to write what you know. I'm not sure what I know on you know, a professional level, but I know what my experiences tell me. Right now, my experiences centre largely on the continued efforts of raising my daughter so that she does not one day end up on the news for some sort of atrocity.

At the very least, I'd want to see her on the TV - or whatever TV is in the future - with the tag line "World's greatest monster?" At least I could be a bit proud about that. I mean [if you can't be famous, be infamous](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0299658/taglines), right?

But before my daughter does me proud by becoming the worlds greatest monster? Or I guess _not_ being that, she's gotta make it there. And if she keeps up the screaming she's doing now during her teething faze, I'm not sure she will.

Now let me clarify: I'm not saying my wife or I would remove our daughter from this mortal coil simply because she's crying. What I'm saying is that if she keeps up the kind of crying that she's doing, she may end up blowing a tiny blood vessel in her head.

## A mighty set of lungs

When my daughter was first born and I heard her first bleak mews into the universe, I said out loud "Hah! Is that as bad as you've got hon? Why that's not bad at all." I honestly said this out loud, within ear shot of other people who I'm sure would love to have a chat with me now. They could roll around in the pile of my arrogance, lapping it up and letting it sustain them.

Oh how arrogant I was.

It turns out children have this habit of growing. As they grow, different parts of them mature: Their limbs grow; their brains develop; their digestive tract actually gets its shit together. All in all it's pretty amazing. One of the other things that happens is that their lungs grow, as does their ability to generate _agonizingly loud mouth sounds._

What my daughter started off with has long since vanished. She can now render a person prone with her wails. Our resident asshole cat, Rion (we did not name him, he came with it) meows just to try and drown it out. This of course only serves to amplify the stress of the situation, but he doesn't care because again, he's an asshole.

## Teething: what in the hell, nature?

Do you know how half-baked humans are, coming into the world? Babies are in no-way finished when they are forced into our universe. Most animals in nature that art born can walk within minutes, run in a few more. They have to, otherwise they'd get eaten.

When a baby is born, they are like a startup [MVP](): functional but so chocked full of bugs that everyone just kind of cringes. Their digestion tract aren't finished; they can't see pretty much at all; they have no control over their limbs for _months_, even longer for fine motor control. They're a mess. If humans hadn't removed ourselves from the food chain, all our babies would be eaten because all they do is announce their presence in the most irritating way possible.

So as a parent, you are made to suffer along with your child. I assume this is so that you have shared experiences and love them more, but it's awful. One such event is teething: that is, when your child starts to develop teeth.

Yeah it only took me 740 words to get to the point of this post. _You're welcome._

## The bity, crying truth of the matter

One of the things with teething is that it can last months, depending on the child. It also affects different children in different ways. It can come in waves. The only reason we know our daughter has started is by the fact that she is chomping down on literally anything she can fit into her [tiny mouth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gj4-E5Hs3Kc).

Apparently this relieves the discomfort somewhat. I say discomfort because that's what everyone with a degree would phrase it as. In reality I'd say my daughter's in a fucktonne of pain, because she will cry perpetually for an hour before she passes out from the exhaustion. It's a pretty rough scene for the little gal.

We've tried all the usual options: hard things to chew on, soft things to chew on, mediumish density items to chew on, clothes, cold stuff, warm stuff. Whatever you got, we've probably tried it. None of it seems to last very long. We've had to resort to giving her medication to take the edge off for her.

We tried natural stuff first, because blah blah big pharma blah blah my wife wanted to try it first blah blah it didn't work blah. Okay that's not fair, because it did indeed work. Her pain seemed to subside. Her throwing up for the rest of the day was a bit of a drawback though. Whatever's in the natural (read: homeopathic) medication took my daughters stomach out back and beat it like it owed the meds money.

Tylonol seems to have saved the day. It takes about 20 minutes before it starts kicking in, but the change is noticeable. We've tried Advil as well, but for whatever reason our daughter's pretty good at spitting that flavour right out. I guess she isn't a fan of "medicinal red" for whatever reason.

## Frustration and understanding

I hope you can appreciate that having a baby who's face hurts all the time isn't exactly an easy situation. She refuses to be put down for any length of time, forcing both my wife and I to take turns hauling our 18ish pound daughter around. This would be bad enough if she wasn't also screaming the entire time.

It's pretty brutal. She's a baby, so you can't exactly explain the monumental changes occurring within the confines of her own skull. Don't get me wrong, we've explained it to her because we're losing it a bit and it's a way of venting. She's not getting it, but it does make us feel better. That's important though, because without a way of venting, we'd probably go insane.

Look at it from the baby's point of view: For no reason you could possibly fathom, part of your head, which you only have a vague understanding of to begin with, hurts like a bastard. You don't know why it started, you don't know that it will ever actually end, and nothing your tiny brain can think to do about it has much of an affect. 

It must be awful for her. It hurts, obviously, but it must also be pretty terrifying. She doesn't yet have any concept of time, so to her this is just her life now. No wonder she's crying; were that my life, I'd probably be screaming at everything as well.

And so, as a parent, we are made to suffer with our children. Her face hurts, and she screams this knowledge at us. We in turn attempt to soothe, medicate, and otherwise do what we can for her. We lose sleep, we lose our patience, we lose our minds a little as well. We'll survive, much like you will if or when your time with a teething child comes.

She'll grow past it eventually, but for now? Nature forces us to adapt. For if we don't adapt, we'll end up laying on our backs, paralyzed, thinking: "Oh. Well. This is _bullshit._"
