        <p>Recently <a href="http://bart.whahay.net/" title="Bartek Ginado">Bart</a> and I went to
<a href="http://www.startupnorth.ca/2007/12/07/startupcamp-toronto-thank-you/" title="StartupCamp Toronto">StartupCamp
Toronto</a>,
a venue for new Canadian startups to demo what they're strut their
snazzy new 2.0 projects, and seek input (if they want) on what they're
trying to accomplish. Five companies demoed their wares, the highlights
amongst them being <a href="http://defensio.com/" title="Defensio">Defensio</a>,
<a href="http://www.cakemail.com/" title="CakeMail">CakeMail</a>, and Investmate. It was
really interesting to see how different companies set about
accomplishing their dreams. I wish I could post pictures I took, or give
you a blow by blow of what went down, but I didn't have any of the tools
to do so with me. I will note that it took place about 200 metres from
<a href="http://www.corusent.com/" title="Corus Entertainment">Corus Entertainment</a> at
<a href="http://www.no-regrets.ca/" title="No Regrets Restaurant &amp; Lounge">No Regrets</a>
(which is as sexy a lounge as I've ever been in). The entire event was
put together by the great folks at
<a href="http://www.startupnorth.ca/" title="StartupNorth">StartupNorth</a></p>
<p>One thing I did notice amongst everything being presented is that with
the exception of <a href="http://www.cakemail.com/" title="CakeMail">CakeMail</a> that
many of them obviously didn't invest too much time in their graphic
design department. <a href="http://www.freshbooks.com/" title="Freshbooks">Freshbooks</a>
wasn't anything special to look at, Investmate to its credit was more of
a technical demo, and <a href="http://www.slashid.com/" title="SlashID">SlashID</a> was
nothing to really write home about.
<a href="http://defensio.com/" title="Defensio">Defensio</a> wasn't bad, though they're
going for a more understated feel.
<a href="http://www.cakemail.com/" title="CakeMail">CakeMail</a> had an original looking
logo, and their website follows suit. Maybe I just wasn't looking hard
enough, but it seemed all the presentations seemed to be more focused on
the technical side then they were the aesthetics.</p>
<p>I'll admit that yes, it was a StartupCamp so there were a lot of fellow
techies there but there were also a lot of people who were obviously
from investment groups. If you're going to demo a product to anyone
other that a Developer, Project Manager, or an otherwise tech-savvy
individual, you gotta make it pretty. It doesn't matter if you've
programmed
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_%28fictional%29" title="Terminator lol">Skynet</a>or
a program that actually calculates Pi. If it's ugly, you're going to
have way more of an uphill struggle with your audience.</p>
<p>I was a little let down on this point, because I was really hoping to
glean some information on how new startups are presenting themselves to
an increasingly-diverse populous. Globalization has sunk its claws into
everything, and these startups are having to compete on a global scale,
right from launch. They need to make sure that they stand out to the
crowd. What's the difference between them and their competitors? Why
should we, the internet population, spend our dollars on you? What's
going to make us remember you more than anyone else? These were things I
was hoping to see, and sadly I was a bit let down.</p>
<p>I was impressed with some of the ideas that I saw though. Investmate had
the most of my attention, and most of the crowds as well. Their product
was basically "stock market for stupid people". Yeah they didn't say
those exact words, but the meaning was there. Their idea was sound, and
they got a lot of good feedback on how to improve the presentation. They
also got a lot of advice from people who have been in the investing
industry for a while, and as such had much in the way of helpful
comments. In the end I don't see their idea being feasible as is, but if
they changed their approach to working with a brokerage instead of
against them, they'd probably have solid end product.</p>
<p>Another observation is that everyone in the startup community seems to
be really, truly helpful. As long as you are not in direct competition
with them, they seem more than willing to help you succeed. As the
presentations went through, and comments made, I noticed that though
blunt as the questions they were never meant in malice. Granted watching
the <a href="http://www.freshbooks.com/" title="Freshbooks">FreshBooks</a> guys catch
fire, get ripped to shreds, and then basically got the red light was
painful to watch. They got ripped into, but again not out of any sense
of meanness merely just based from observations. I hope they learned
something from it in the end.</p>
<p>It was a very educational experience and I am looking forward to
attending more of them in the future. Thankfully there's one happening
in Montreal in January and another in February so I haven't got to wait
too long!</p>
<p>P.S. Did I mention that I was approached by a man who mentioned that he
was the creator of
<a href="http://www.expedia.ca/pub/agent.dll?qscr=chlg&amp;ovrd=2" title="Expedia">Expedia.ca</a>?
Well I did. He's a stunningly smart man, and really easy to talk to. He
apparently sold it and helps startups now. That must be a fun life.</p>
