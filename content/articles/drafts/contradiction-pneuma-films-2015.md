When's the last time you played a game with live-action acting? Wing Commander 3, perhaps? Or maybe you need to go further back, such as a couple star games on Sega CD or the 3DO? I know I was a sucker for Sherlock Holmes: Consulting detective (though to be honest I never actually solved a single case).

They were good times then. Simpler times. Terribly acted, best left in the past times. I honestly didn't know FMVs were still being made, though a couple have come across my radar recently. One such game, Contradiction, got a decent amount of attention. So much so that I was persuaded to purchase it after a night of not insubstantial drinking.

I should make more of my purchasing decisions while half a bottle of [Spicebox](http://spiceboxwhisky.com/) into my evening, because Contradiction is fabulous.

##Synopsis
You are detective Jenks, you've been sent to investigate the apparent suicide of Kate  #something#. Apparently someone isn't convinced that it wasn't so cut and dry. You're given until the following day (more accurately until midnightish), to draw your conclusions and be on your way.

As you start digging into the death, you start to see that things are not what they seem. Everyone has secrets, and no one is really in the mood to help a police officer dig through theirs or their neighbours metaphorical trash. As the night goes on, the story twists on itself repeatedly, presenting you with new information, much of which is no more than circumstantial evidence or utter misdirection.

You wander the town, annoying it's inhabitants to no end until at last you figure out what, if anything, happened that fateful Friday night. It's a classing whodunit #STOPPED HERE#

##Gameplay
The game, for the most part, is a very straight-forward adventure game. You have navigation arrows to move you from screen to screen, you have a map to quick-jump from area to area, you have an inventory where you can review your notes and look at all the junk you acquire. Let's be honest here, Jenks basically roots through people stuff, without a warrant, and just takes what he wants. The man is a loose cannon, playing by his own rules. If he didn't get results, by God he'd be off the force.

You navigate the town, finding evidence, interviewing people, and as it says in the title, find contradictions. You present the contradictions by selecting 2 statements given by the person you are interviewing, and more story is revealed. 

As you progress through your interviews, certain events will trigger time to move forward. As near as I can tell, there doesn't seem to be a way to end up in a fail-state scenario, so that's not really something you need worry about.

##Issues
###The interface is a nightmare
- ugly as all hell
- random key assignment (though you can change that)
###Seemingly lost preferences
- Every time I started the game, it told me to check my key bindings
- Always had to re-enable subtitles (I have a crying baby, I need the text there)
###Aimless wandering
- left wandering the map sometimes for events to fire
- some contradictions are not obvious
- Once I started the game, it always sent me back to the centre of town
###Contradictions are limited
- This was probably my biggest irritation, and that's saying something given how much I hated the aimless wandering.
- Cannot use others statements/information against your current interviewee
###Control scheme
- Obviously was an ipad game first
- keys seem to function differently within different menus
- other keys didn't seem to do anything, even when they were listed in the menu
###Controller support
- Not a problem personally, but from what I've read, a lot of people were upset at the lack of, and then buggy support of, controllers.

7/10
