On the weekend I went out with Theresa and four others (sister, roomie,
and the boyfriends) to one of the only things to do in North Bay. You
really only get four options: Drink, have sex, go to the mall, or go to
the movies. Well you can mix and match those, but that's basically it.
Regardless, we went to the movies.

This is where I saw Good Luck Chuck.

Now I've heard people saying that either it was good, or it sucked
dirty, smelly anus. The bell curve for this movie and the people who
watched it vs people who liked it leans towards people whom I tend to
agree with. This was not a good movie. Having said that, this was not a
bad movie either.

Dane Cook isn't funny. That's my opinion and I'm sticking with it. He's
not a bad actor as it turns out as he manages to play his on-screen
persona well enough. You can pretty much repeat that last sentence for
everyone in this film with the exception of Jessica Alba's stoner
brother, who fails at acting and acting like a stoner. All the
characters were utterly 2-dimensional (even the breast-enhancement
girls), so if you were looking for character development of any sort you
will be sadly disappointed.

The premise was pretty cut n' dry: Man is cursed never to be happy with
a girl, man falls in love. Man tries to break the curse and scares girl.
Montage to guy getting girl back, with a happy ending kiss. When you
think about it, you can swap out the "guy gets cursed" with "guy is
ugly," "guy is shy," and so on and so forth. The process is pretty much
the same thing. If you were looking for an epic, intriguing, dynamic, or
otherwise interesting plot you will be mad for spending your dimes.

Now I'm trying not to bash the movie completely so I'll say that I went
in expecting nothing, and I got a few laughs out of it. I could have
done without seeing a man masturbating into a grapefruit, but you can't
win them all. The movie is fairly gag-heavy, which gets tiresome after
the 90th time. Like I said though I did laugh at some points and I'm
generally hard to impress with gags, so there's something that shines in
the movie.

I'd say acquire the movie temporarily to view it, and if you can avoid
spending money on it, all the better.

4/10
