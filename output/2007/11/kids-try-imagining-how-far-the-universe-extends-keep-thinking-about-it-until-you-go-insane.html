        <p>I'm on a slight <a href="http://www.telltalegames.com/samandmaxseasontwo" title="Sam &amp; Max">Sam &amp;
Max</a> binge
at the moment, so you will forgive my use of a quote from one of their
many adventures.</p>
<p>I've been somewhat busy over the past little while what with work and
all. I've finally started my job at The Revolution Night Club in
Waterloo. I thought that my working from 10 to 3 in the morning would
beat me up way more then it actually has. As long as I get a nap in
before going to work, I'm fine. Besides, It allows me to wake up at 12
in the afternoon, which is some sort of accomplishment for me.</p>
<p>Since this is one of my few pointless personal posts, I figure I may as
well talk about what it is that I do there. I have the glamorous job of
bussing. "What is bussing?" you ask? A busser is that sucker that walks
around picking up empty, abandoned, or otherwise useless husks that are
the plastic cups, glasses, and bottles which once housed booze. A busser
is, for lack of a better term, a janitor. We clean up the drinks,
spills, and when it happens, vomit that occurs throughout the night.
It's not a great job, but I actually don't mind it. I found I can tune
out the thug music stunningly well, and I'm apparently good at my job. I
don't mind vomit, I'm good at moving through crowds of people, and my
father-blessed work ethic makes me do my job well.</p>
<p>I have learned some things from the two shifts I have worked, and I feel
the need to share some of these things. To make things convenient, here
is a list:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pay attention to your drinks people</strong>. It's a waste of money to
    buy a drink, only to drink 3 sips of it and abandon it for
    any reason. You know as well as I do that you won't drink it when
    you come back, and all you've managed to do is waste perfectly good
    alcohol, and your cash.</li>
<li><strong>Drunk people are generally nice</strong>. I always thought that the Rev
    was a den of assholes who are itching for a fight. Not true, as it
    turns out. People are, for the most part, nice the more alcohol
    they consume.</li>
<li><strong>The difference between the 19+ night and the 21+ night is
    *staggering</strong>*. On the 19+ night, no one is allowed to have bottles,
    the girls dress like tramps, and the guys are all trying to impress.
    Apparently aging two years does wonders for maturity levels. So much
    so that people can drink from bottles, dress more respectably, and
    dance on stages.</li>
<li><strong>People never go when there is no cover</strong>. The Rev is free until
    10:30 pm. Why is it that people don't show up until 12 am then? What
    a waste of money people. it's 6 bucks to get into the club after
    10:30, so why not just go early and relax while there is a lull in
    the person count. It'll help you get more drinks faster as well.</li>
<li><strong>Girls dress like tramps</strong>, and it's not impressing anyone. If
    you're using your curves (or a lack therein) to attract a mate,
    trust me when I say that they'll probably be lacking any
    redeemable qualities. Please don't disrespect yourself by dressing
    like a hooker. If you do, you're not allowed to get mad when guys
    stare at your jiggly bits. Have some self-respect.</li>
<li><strong>People don't really start to drink until nearly 1 am</strong>. Then it
    gets fucking crazy.<!--adsense--></li>
<li><strong>A lot of people can't dance</strong>. I'm not saying they shouldn't,
    because dancing is fun and who cares what anyone else thinks. Though
    if you are trying to impress the opposite sex (or the same if thats
    your bag) you have to learn at the very least how to not look like
    an epileptic monkey on the dance floor.</li>
<li><strong>Girls like to scream/cheer at the most random shit</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Remixes are preferred to the originals</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Only white folk seem to like Techno</strong>. I don't want to generalize
    here, but that what I've seen thus far.</li>
<li><strong>3 out of 100 people know how to dance to Techno</strong>. Considering our
    Techno room only holds like, 150 people, thats not a good ratio.</li>
<li><strong>Girls thank you for taking away empty drinks. Guys nod</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Never try and pick up at a 19+ night</strong>. You don't want what's
    being served. If you really want to pick up, go to the 21+ or
    25+ nights. Everyone is more relaxed and easy-going.</li>
<li><strong>Don't go to bars or clubs by yourself</strong>. It's fucking depressing
    to look at. If you do go alone, at least mingle with people. Don't
    sit at a booth by yourself. You can sit at home in your underwear
    and drink if you want to feel depressed. You really don't need to
    see everyone else being happy to get you to that low.</li>
<li><strong>I love ear plugs</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>To hell with everyone who said steel-toed shoes were a bad idea</strong>.
    Drunk people are clumsy, and I've had my foot stepped on a lot
    considering I've worked two shifts.</li>
</ol>
<p>On top of all that, working this job also has the added bonus of working
out some muscle groups that never get taxed. So by working this job, I
should technically end up in better physical shape.</p>
<p>In other, not Rev related news, I've almost finished reading Wicked, and
my review should be posted some time this week, assuming I have the time
to finish it. It's a good book so far, though I won't give away my
thoughts just yet. I'm also going to try and finish Mario: Thousand Year
Door. I have a horrible habit of getting through games to about the 80%
mark, and then just dropping it. I've done that to at least three games
that I can think of off the top of my head. I'm also going to try and
get some more writing in. By my figuring (which involves a very complex
equation that factors work, laziness, and drive) I should be finished my
"book" by the year 2016.</p>
<p>Oh and before I forget, I got the chance to see <a href="http://www.van-halen.com/" title="Van Halen">Van
Halen</a> in concert on Thursday.
Free tickets given to me by a co-worker. I've never listened to Van
Halen actively, so this was basically a crash course in their music.
It's pretty good, if not a tad shallow. Everything was from the 1984
album or before. What really made the concert for me were the two solos
within the show. The drum solo had me smiling throughout the whole
thing, and the guitar solo left me stunned into silence. I'm pretty sure
I'm not alone in my feelings as the entire stadium (and there were a
<em>lot</em> of people) was utterly silent throughout the guitar. I'm happy I
got to see it, though I'm a little sad we missed <a href="http://www.thehip.com/" title="The Tragically Hip">The Tragically
Hip</a>.</p>
<p>That should wrap things up for now.</p>
