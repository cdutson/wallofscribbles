The whole CD has a slightly surreal feel to it, but that's probably
because of the slight Emo (yes I'm aware that current Emo is not real
Emo) feel and lyrics that are spread throughout the songs. I'm not
saying that they're depressing, but many of the tracks tend to put me
into more of a reflective mood then say, a slap-happy moshing mood. What
I noticed from the first song, and what permeates the entire track
listing is a solid feel to it all. Every song seems very refined and
well put together.

Another interesting tidbit I will point out is that each song seems to
have a slightly different feel. I'm aware that I just stated how there
is an overlaying Emo-esque to it all, but each song seems to go about it
in a slightly different fashion. It's refreshing because it allows for a
very diverse album without jumping all over the board. The downside to
it is that either you will like a lot of the songs, or get annoyed with
them fairly quickly. I am the former, but I'm not going to make judgment
calls for you.

I'm glad to have it a part of my library, and can honestly say that I'll
probably end up listening to this one for a long, long time. Overall,
it's totally worth owning.

8/10
