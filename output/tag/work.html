            <p>So I've been doing a lot of javascript development at work recently.
I've basically created a lot of our reusable javascript 'plugins' to
cover the common requirements of the work that we do. In many cases,
this resides mostly (but not entirely) in online annual-report creation.</p>
<p>Anyone that's in the business will know that there are some common
functional elements that you end up having to build with javascript:
accordions, tabs, faders, sliders, lightboxes, filters, etc. Many of
these items can bleed over into non-report sites, such as intranets or
even public-facing sites.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>Now some of those are fairly straight forward: an accordion is just a
simple animate of a content section, repeat per title; tabs? Same ...</p></!--more-->

            <p>Back in the day, I worked at a place that, while educational, was
terrible to work at in a first world sort of way. I wasn't getting paid
my due, the atmosphere wasn't what one would call supportive, and the
management was... well that's where this story comes in. I won't name
the company, though why I'm protecting them is beyond me. Anyone with a
bit of investigative skills can figure out where this was. I'll even
give you a clue: It wasn't a school.</p>
<p>Anyways, I was a developer at a smaller web development company that was
run more through fear and unreasonable expectations than through proper
management savvy. This place also ...</p>

            <p>That is, of course, because after roughly 6 months, I am actually
writing something!</p>
<p>I hope you've found religion, because I'm going to start doing this more
often. What does this mean? This means that Corey is finally getting off
his lazy god-damned-ass and is going to start writing words in sequence
again.</p>
<p>Now if you put these sequenced words together, you will find that they
make sentences. These sentences, when grouped into logical sections
well, they become paragraphs. If I can actually manage to put enough of
these words onto a page, you could actually become entertained by what
may be considered an editorial, a review, or a terrifying essay about
clowns that live within your closet ...</p>

            <h3>Know your time lines and stick to them</h3>
<p>This is pretty straightforward people. <em>Know when you need to deliver</em>
things by (milestones, project builds, documents, etc) and make sure
they're delivered by that date/time. When things start slipping from the
timeline, then it just compounds as one section runs into another.
Believe me when I say that there is only so much overlap you can
orchestrate before something breaks. Think Jenga.</p>
<p>On that same note, make sure that your time requirements are accurate. I
cannot stress that enough. If you think something should only take you
an hour, give yourself 2. If you end up ahead of schedule, great! You've
just created buffer time for when something ...</p>

creep</a>
was rampant to a scale that I have not experienced since, and that's
saying something. I've had projects where I've been up for over 40 hours
straight working because of scope creep, and I can assure that none of
them fell anywhere near what I was supposed to do for this company. On
top of that, every section had to have their own way of doing things,
and I had to try and figure out how to fit it all together in one neat,
little package.</p>

noticed that seem to have fallen off the face of the planet. This is, of
course, an ignorant assumption because of gravity. It is impossible to
fall off the planet, let alone its face.</p>
<p>I have however been busy with life, being lazy with updating this, and
other lame excuses that I cannot fathom at the moment.</p>
<p>I'm not going to bother with all that because quite honestly I was just
lazy and had no drive to update this site. No real reason, but I'm back
to take another stab at it.</p>
