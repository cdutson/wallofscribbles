Much of the movie revolves around the Vietnam War, and the protests that
went on during the time. All the characters are pulled into differing
sub-cultures and left to their own devices, and are let to play out
their lives with what they've gotten themselves into. It demonstrates
what people are capable of when they feel the need to work for
something. It displays people in their best and worst moments without
much in the ways of compromise, and shows that people aren't perfect nor
do situations always work out glowing. It does glaze over one or two
areas that probably could have had more explaining, but you cannot
realize this during the film and it probably isn't worth dwelling over.

I was captivated throughout the movie, though I could say that some
scenes could have been cut a tad shorter or removed simply to save time.
There was little point to some scenes other then to demonstrate a
characters inner feeling(s) at that moment. In some cases this is deep
and truly moving, others it just seems like they needed something to
help separate scenes. Having said that, Prudence probably could have
been left out of the movie as she didm't really do anything for it. She
felt more like a song que and a side-kick throughout the film and hence
a filler character.

The music is completely comprised of songs from The Beatles, but re-sung
by the characters in the movie. It contained stunning visual effects and
a solid flow. Some of the more... outlandish scenes were a little
strenuous on the eyes, and let me tell you that on a digital projector
those scenes tended to be both stunning and blinding. Don't take that
the wrong way, they were amazing and original, but *wow*. If thats what
acid trips look like, count me out. As the movie progresses, the visual
effects and ques become more obvious to the watcher, and helps integrate
the viewer into the characters lives. Helping them to see what the
characters see. Mr. Kite's musical scene was ... amazing, terrifying and
utterly mind-shattering all at once.

If you enjoy musicals, this is a complete must-see. If you don't like
musicals, screw it and watch it anyways. It's a well directed film with
impressive direction and plays out smoothly. It's a simple movie about
love and what people are willing to go through for it, and the hopeless
romantic in me glowed from watching it.

Oh, and I will be picking up the soundtrack for this as soon as humanly
possible.

8.3/10
