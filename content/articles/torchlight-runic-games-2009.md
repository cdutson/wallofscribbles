on the XBox Arcade. From my vague recollections, Torchlight was
something like Diablo, but streamlined and graphically updated.

Believe it or not, that's pretty much it. Well, except the compelling
storyline.

Synopsis
--------

So your character (one of three builds) decides for vaguely heroic
reasons to hack their way across the world to the small town of
Torchlight. It's a mining town, and they trade mostly in 'ember.' Ember
is a precious crystal that is imbued with magical powers. Think materia,
if you're from a Final Fantasy background.

Anyways, like the Dwarfs from Lord of the Rings, they miners went too
deep, and got too greedy. The end result is that the dark n' evil things
living in the bowels of the earth are now free-roaming. This is
obviously bad for business, the town, and probably for the world to some
extent. Think of the market spikes!

You roll up into town and take it upon yourself to rid the mines of
evil. You also get to rid it of any valuables along the way, which I'm
pretty sure is the unspoken rule with heros. A sort of payment
in lieu. You button mash your way down through the levels of the mine,
getting ever closer to the cause of all the bad...ness. Badness. Yeah,
sure let's just leave that one sitting there.

Gameplay
--------

I have no idea how this plays on a computer (it's platform of origin)
but it plays out pretty smoothly on a console. The controls are simple,
and you can customize them to best suit your playing style. Well mostly.
Some keys are perma-bound, but it's not that rough.

So Torchlight does play almost exactly like Diablo, which makes sense
given that the team that made it [worked on Diablo in the first
place](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torchlight "Wikipedia - Torchlight").
I'd say there was a conflict of interest or stolen IP or something, but
I assume Blizzard hasn't noticed; they've been to busy rolling around on
their giant piles of money. It takes the same isometric angle, the
same horde of monsters approach, the same skill tree system, etc.

Seriously it's Diablo. If you enjoyed the mechanics of Diablo, you'll
enjoy the mechanics of Torchlight, as there is almost nothing that's
different.

You can gamble, you can socket, you can enchant, you can use town portal
scrolls, you have to use identify scrolls, there are level portals you
can use to quick travel. The music is even similar (again, same people
working on it), so you'll feel right at home ripping baddies apart.

A lot of effort was put into making the controls as simple as possible
for the player. You have a smashy button, a block button, a healing
button, and a mana restore button. Every other button can be mapped to
whatever you want. This allows you to set up your skill load-outs as
needed. On top of that, you can get use the D-pad to swap between
loadouts, so that you can have specific setups for specific situations.

Graphics
--------

The graphics are shockingly rich, though given it's a 3/4ths view game
where you can't really zoom in, I doubt they had to work all that hard
on the textures. Regardless, The environments look lush, the enemies
match the style of the game, and your character looks reasonably
bad-ass. The detail put into the spells and ambient lighting is
impressive, I must say. If anything, they probably put more effort into
that than the rest of the texture work.

Now that all being said, when you do get to look at your character
close-up, they do start to look a bit boxy. For obvious reasons, the
poly-count was probably toned back as much as possible. When you start
trying to render 20-30 badguys on the screen at once, you really want to
try and make that as easy as possible on your rendering engine. Sadly
though, it does make parts of the game look cheap.

Music
-----

Have you played Diablo or Diablo 2 at all? If so, you'll feel right at
home in Torchlight. I mean, they got the [same
guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Uelmen "Wikipedia - Matt Uelmen")
that did Diablos music to write the score(s?) for Torchlight. While
Torchlight does have its own feel in with the music, you can't help but
thing that the composer probably didn't have to work all that hard to
put it together.

Issues
------

### It's boring.

If you are looking for a deep, driving storyline, you won't find it
here. If you want to feel like a god as you mow down 20 guys at the same
time, you'll have fun. It's not that it's boring to play so much as it's
not compelling you to play through it. It really is a game for those who
like to grind through levels and power up like mad.

In terms of story... well there is no story really. I honestly didn't
give a toss about anyone or anything in the game, and that includes my
little wolf sidekick. There aren't really other characters, so much as
there are NPCs who will shower you with 'quests' and gold and such.

### It's easy.

If you spend a couple minutes looking over your skill-tree, you'll
realize that there's a pretty easy setup that you can go through that
will basically make you a god. That's what I did, and even though I
played well past the end of the main story, I only died 2 or 3 times.
Those deaths were normally caused by me just not looking at the screen.
Which brings me to the other part of this:

All you have to do is button mash. Never have I played a game that
rewarded button mashing so much. It's stupid. What's worse is that you
*have* to button mash. I'd love to target something and have my
character bash the shit out of it until it dies, I die, or I decide to
change tactics. I shouldn't have to ruin 2 buttons on my controller just
to play through a game.

Overall

Is it a bad game? No. Was it fun? Yes. Would I play it again with the
other characters? Nuh uh. Would I buy it again? probably not. Do I feel
like I wasted my money? Nah.

5/10
