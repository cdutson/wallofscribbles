[Ice Station
Santa](http://www.telltalegames.com/samandmaxseasontwo/ "Ice Station Santa")
is the first installment for the second "season" of Telltales expansion
of the Sam & Max universe. I grew up with the original [Sam &
Max](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_&_Max_Hit_the_Road "Sam & Max Hit the Road"),
and so when I heard tell of a new company taking over the title - since
[LucasArts](http://www.lucasarts.com/index.htmls "Morons") is run by
morons and discontinued the title - I was a little worried. Hell I
remember the short-lived cartoon, which though enjoyable had screwed
with my young sensibilities. The voices weren't the same and it really
bugged me.

The basis of this episode is that Sam & Max receive a wonderful present
- The Maimtron 9000 - That tries to murder them while reciting 80's
music lyrics. This leads to finding out that it was a gift, sent to you
by Santa, who by the way is toting a Red Rider hand-held machine gun.
You take off to the North Pole, and the mayhem and hilarity ensues. The
writing in this episode is just as good as the others... though to be
honest I can't say that they're been any improvement. They've all pretty
much sustained really solid scripting from the get go.

I'm happy to say that [Telltale
Games](http://www.telltalegames.com/ "Telltale Games") (who is made up
of former LucasArts employees) have done an admirable job of reviving
and progressing the Sam & Max universe. The voices still aren't the
originals, but the game makes up for it by having a stunningly twisted
storyline, borderline-raunchy jokes, and the same feel as the original
(that is to say, totally and wonderfully screwed up). There have been
numerous improvements to the environment from the first season,
including new areas, upgrading of old areas, new characters, and the
ability to run over Torture me Elmurs. Let's not forget that the game
delves into temporal mechanics by creating self-fulfilling paradoxes.
I'm always game for those.

I did feel that this episode was a little short and a little aimless. I
got stuck at one point simply because I forgot about one item. ONE. Now
granted, I could have turned the hint level right up and gotten help,
but I really shouldn't have to. These points really hurt what would have
otherwise been fairly solid game play.

In the end, this was a purchase I cannot possibly regret. The game had
me laughing out loud at least every 5 minutes, 1 minute if you count
anything to do with *Pimp le Car*. it's a little aimless, but I can
forgive that given the quality of the game.

7/10

PS. For the fans out there who have a touch of the engineering bug,
[here is a tutorial](http://spritesmods.com/?art=wcterror "tutorial") on
how to make your own Sam & Max Terror Level alert sign. I don't have the
drive to build it, but it seems like a pretty straight forward tutorial.
Have fun!
