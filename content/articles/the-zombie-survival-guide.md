I can honestly say that by reading this book, I actually do feel
somewhat more comfortable about my chances should the dead rise again.
Suffice it to say, Max Brooks takes the idea rather seriously. So
seriously that he has covered everything in this book. Weapons, Survival
gear, locational ratings, terrain types, preventive plans, cleanup
plans, and even a worst case scenario. In all honesty it was in fact, a
honest to God guide on surviving the zombie hordes that come, shambling
and disheveled, to your door.

As a result, the first half of the book (the guide half, which is closer
to three quarters, really) was eventually a bit of a dry read. I'm not
saying this is in any way a bad thing, as any sort of survival guide you
pick up will be just this. It was informative, though none of the
information can be scientifically backed up (Solanum for example), but
much of it is simply common sense. Mr Brooks does an admirable job of
depicting how people generally would react, and how you the reader,
should react in a whole slew of situations.

The second half of the book provides a bit more entertainment as it is a
compounded list of tales, sightings and first hand reports from people
across the world and through time of Zombie outbreaks as well as their
outcomes. Though again I would not consider this humerous as the book
does not even attempt at humour, I would consider it at the very least a
more enjoyable read through the fictitious novel.

If nothing else and the Zombies come wailing at my door, I can take them
down like it's going out of style.

6.5/10 overall, a solid read, though be wary that this book does take
itself rather seriously.
