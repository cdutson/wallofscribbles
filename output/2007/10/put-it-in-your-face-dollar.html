        <p>Hello one and all, I hope you've been keeping well! I've been pretty
mentally exhausted all week but I still managed to keep the content
rolling out. I've even managed to start a new book (already 160 pages
in) and actually do a bit of writing (another chapter 'done') and
generally getting some tasks out of the way. It's been a productive, but
exhausting week. So much trekking around, it's insane.</p>
<p>Highlights of the week include:</p>
<p><strong>I hate InfoPath:</strong><br />
I know the idea behind the program is sound, and I'm impressed with the
level of integration that Microsoft has managed to achieve with
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepointserver/FX100492001033.aspx" title="Microsoft SharePoint 2007">SharePoint
2007</a>
and
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/infopath/FX100487661033.aspx" title="InfoPath 2007">InfoPath</a>.
What I don't like is all the very, very moronic design choices they made
with the InfoPath GUI, the blatant limitations with the items therein
(what program doesn't allow tables to have id's honestly) and the very
depressing requirement of absolute URL references for important items.
Items such as data sources, links, validation servers etc. I also
dislike how trying to get a form from one server to another has way too
many manual steps required. I shouldn't have to upload the form, and
then have to change the references in said form manually. There should
be some sort of stream-lined upload process for that.</p>
<p>The concept of the product is great, but the execution needs work. Much
work. I can only cringe as I see more work with this product coming down
the line. At least I got it done on time, against the wire I should add.
I didn't even care if I got praise or not for this one. I just wanted it
done.</p>
<p><strong>A Half-missed Concert:</strong><br />
Richard got us some tickets to go see
<a href="http://www.spoontheband.com/" title="Spoon">Spoon</a> and <a href="http://www.theponys.com/" title="The Ponys">The
Ponys</a> in Toronto. The tickets
clearly stated that the show started at 10:15 pm. We whined because it
was a late show and would be pathetic-looking at work but whatever.
Suffer for the music and all that. We ended up getting there early so we
decided to wander around Toronto's harbor-front. It's really pretty in a
weird sort of way, especially at night. We found a whole wack of used
book stores and had a look around. We both ended up buying copies of <a href="http://www.iamnotmyselfthesedays.com/" title="I am not myself these days">I
am not myself these days: A
Memoir</a>.
We made it back to the concert hall around 10 and walked in. We saw guys
on stage setting things up, so we figured "great, we made it just in
time. We're so cunning."</p>
<!--adsense-->

<p>The band came out on stage and played... and played... and played. Don't
get me wrong: I love concerts and music, but an hour and a half set
(without encores) is a little much. In any case they walked off stage
and we waited for the next band to come out. Then the first band came
out and played an encore. Richard and I were both rather confused by
this taboo behavior but figured "it's an indie show, they can do
whatever the hell they want." They finished up their three-song encore
and walked off stage. Then they came on <em>again</em>. Now I'm getting
annoyed. The lead singer had basically been masturbating with his guitar
all night to the crowd and after nearly two hours I was getting sick of
them. They finished their <em>second</em> three-song encore and walked off
stage, this time saying they were done. Hurray!</p>
<p>Then the houselights came on, and everyone started leaving. Both Richard
and myself were now suffering from a complete mindfuck, and it honestly
took us like 4 minutes to realize we missed the first band completely.
Apparently the time changed when they moved venues (originally at <a href="http://www.toronto.com/bars_clubs/listing/000-100-062" title="The Phoenix">The
Phoenix</a>,
they moved to the <a href="http://www.theguvernment.com/" title="Kool Haus">Kool Haus</a>
for reasons I don't understand). On the plus side, we got a new book to
read and got home about 2 hours earlier then we thought we were.</p>
<p>Coincidentally we don't know which band we saw. We think it was The
Ponys but we'll never know for sure.</p>
<p>Oh and as an aside, I'd like to write a quick letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Indie crowd,</p>
<p>Stop smoking so much fucking weed. Seriously. They didn't have any
smoke machines at that concert, and yet the air was hazy. And if you
are going to smoke that crap, at the very least blow your smoke
upwards, and not directly into my face. Actions like that tend to make
me punchy.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Corey.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Friendsgiving:</strong><br />
Though not yet an official holiday, it was great to get so many of my
friends together in one place. What made it even better was the fact
that everyone brought something to contribute to the night, whether it
was food or games or whatever. Dinner was fantastic, and the turkey was
fantastic, the potatoes were great, and I did not know you could use
maple syrup in so many ways. My pies were well received, and by the end
of it all we were happy, stuffed little people.</p>
<p>Then the drinking started. And the games, and the Guitar Hero followed
shortly after. The title of this post is actually the utterance of
<a href="http://bart.whahay.net/" title="Bartek!">Bart's</a> brother as he played a game
of <em>Aliens vs. Spacemen</em>, a game we created using a
<a href="http://www.hasbro.com/games/family-games/jenga/" title="Jenga">Jenga</a> tower
and some plastic aliens/spacemen. Believe me, there was much debate
within the creation of the rules but I think we got something
marketable.</p>
<p>I really hope this becomes a yearly thing, because it's a great chance
to catch up with people you haven't seen much of, as well as an excuse
to eat really yummy food.</p>
<p>I'm sure there were other things, but as my brain as the recall ability
of a rock, this'll have to do. Stay tuned for more reviews and the like.
As an aside, I dislike the "More" tag. Don't like how it works or looks
on the site.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So i called up Marie; she'd have sex for free,<br />
 but for 10 bucks an hour she'd listen to me<br />
 Talk about rock stars and models on dope,<br />
 and why I can't cope with this scene.</p>
