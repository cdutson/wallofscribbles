Lars (Ryan Gosling) is a recluse who, as recluses tend to do, hides
himself from the world. He shuns the advances of a girl from work (Kelli
Garner), and avoids any sort of situation (i.e., breakfast) with anyone.
After a bit of a confrontation with his sister-in-law (Emily Mortimer),
he gets a Real Doll, Bianca, from the web and claims he "met her on the
internet". She is wheelchair-bound, but very sweet. Lars treats her like
she's completely real and the town decides to go along with it to help
Lars through whatever psychological delusion he is having. As a result
the whole town bonds with Bianca, and helps Lars come to terms with how
the world works.

And no, he doesn't sleep with Bianca.

I found it surprisingly entertaining, though a bit run of the mill. I
saw everything coming before it happened including the ending. I'm not
saying that's bad by any means because it was a very sweet movie, and
made me smile for a good while after watching it. It's just a nice movie
to watch, especially when you're feeling a bit of a recluse yourself.



It has a strong feeling of coming of age, but by throwing it through
such a different light it allows you to appreciate it without having the
cast all 28-year-olds pretending they're 17 at the prom. There are
deeper moral lessons to be found within the film, if you're willing to
look for them; the largest and most prominent is the idea that you
should help those you love, regardless of what that means. There is a
scene where Gus and Karin argue about going along with the Real Doll
that I just have to quote here:

> *[Lars Lindstrom](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0331516/)*: You don't

>  *[Karin](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0607865/)*: We don't care? We do
> care!  
>  *[Lars Lindstrom](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0331516/)*: No you

>  *[Karin](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0607865/)*: That is just not

> so much to do? Huh? Huh? Because of you! Because - all these people -

> None of this is easy - for any of us - but we do it... Oh! We do it

Something about this scene just touched me. It's so strong and so honest
that it endeared me to Karin for the rest of the movie.

The music (and in many scenes the stark lack of) was amazing, and I'm
trying to get my grubby little hands on it. It's been a while since I've
seen music that suits a movie so well. Ryan Gosling gives an admirable
performance as Lars, and kudos must also go to Karin, his sister-in-law.
The cinematography was top notch considering one of the actors wasn't
even real. Despite this setback, scenes are still filled with the
emotion needed to carry it through with flying colours.

I have to complain about two things. The first is the rest of the cast:
everyone else seems very cookie cutter. The older brother who snorts at
the idea of his brother having a delusion; The awkward-cute girl that
likes Lars; the work pervert; the black girl; the knitting circle; etc.
Lars and Karin are the only two characters with any real character. My
second annoyance is with the multiple instances of montages. At least
four happen throughout the film, and I couldn't help but let it bug me.

Watch this movie. It won't win any awards, but it's a solid movie from
every aspect. Good story, great acting, fantastic music, and a warm
fuzzy moral in the end.

7.5/10
