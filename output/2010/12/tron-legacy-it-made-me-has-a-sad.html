        <p>I am so very sorry that this is the first movie review I have written
in... However long it's been... has to be for TRON Legacy. <a href="/2010/12/09/rudy-2-this-time-its-personal/" title="Corey Dutson - Rudy 2: This Time it's Personal">Rudy
2</a>
doesn't really count. Hey it's my website and what I say goes, junior.</p>
<p>I'll do my best to follow a format or at least some kind of general
flow, but thats going to be hard. The reason is because TRON Legacy
sucked. It sucked so very, <em>very</em> badly. At this point feel free to
insert whatever sort of 'your mother', 'thats what she said', or
whatever else variable joke you can associate with that statement. I
will also state that I haven't seen the original TRON, but im pretty
sure if I had, I'd have probably been pretty upset with what the new
release has done.</p>
<p>So with that out of the way...</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p><a href="http://wallofscribbles.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/tron_legacy_01.jpg"><img alt="What an unfortunate
waste." src="http://wallofscribbles.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/tron_legacy_01.jpg" title="TRON Legacy" /></a>TRON
legacy, near as I could tell, goes like this: A boy's father either
<strong>a:</strong> made the original TRON and goes back in to perfect it; or, <strong>b:</strong>
was in the last movie, but was probably not the original creator, and
instead goes to make a new version and/or work on the old version.</p>
<p>Anyways, some obvious logic issues crop up and the computer program,
CLUE, that Kevin Flynn created betrayed him. Why? Because users were an
imperfection, and CLUE was told to create the perfect system. Like I
said, basic logic problems. This is logic loops 101 for god sake.</p>
<p>Fast forward roughly 20 years, and our protagonist, Sam Flynn, who
happens to be the major share holder of his fathers company but refuses
to chair the thing due to his inability to grow up, ends up getting a
cryptic message from his fathers old arcade (P.S. his father owned an
arcade that somehow hasn't been torn down or vandalized in the last 20
years. Oh, and it still has electricity). He then gets sucked into the
TRON universe where it turns out it was all a master plot by CLUE so he
can somehow come into the real world etc. Etc. Oh and the son has to get
back to the portal (which is in a totally different place than where he
came in for some reason) or he will be trapped there forever (like his
dad).</p>
<p><em>Que the hilarity</em>.</p>
<h2>Issues</h2>
<p>The premise itself isn't terrible. Is it oscar worthy? <em>Fuck</em> no, but
then again a lot of movies I enjoy can be classed in such a way. It's a
sci-fi movie, and as with all sci-fi movies, I have long since learned
to let a lot of shit slide. A lot of utterly bizarre, useless, or
outright insane things can and should just be accepted for the sake of
the movie. Hell the only time I generally get pissed is when known
scientific facts, such as physics, are thrown into a dark cupboard and
kept there all night without its dinner.</p>
<p>TRON legacy really pushes a lot of the scientific boundary stuff but
it's an entirely new world so okay fine, whatever you want to do in that
universe is well enough. I wont even touch on the fact that it was a
linux build, and somehow didn't crash or require any sort of
bootstrapping to get going.</p>
<p>Now, I could create a list of the obvious flaws, of which there are
<em>many</em>, such as how come light planes can somehow stall in a world that
effectively has no atmosphere. I wont though, because it would
both quadruple the length of this review, and there are others who have
done a much better job than I could. Google yourself some reviews and
you'll see what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>My major issue is the fact that the acting in this movie, with a
quazi-exception for Simon Pegg, was by far <strong>the worst acting I have
seen in a large scale movie.</strong>.. Possibly ever. Seriously. Everyone is
pushing for a single-dimension of complexity, and their character bios
can be drawn in goddamned smelly-marker.<br />
Like so:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kevin Flynn, Father, ambitious when young, hoisted by own petard
    when older. When old becomes a zen hippy who will sacrifice himself
    for his son to make up for fucking off for 20 years. Make sure he
    says some obviously hippy things, like "harshing my mellow" or
    something, but make sure they are all delivered painfully.</li>
<li>Sam Flynn, Son, a renegade that doesn't want to grow up nor take
    over his fathers company due to resentment. Basically trys to
    emulate the new Kirk, but without the acting flair or joy.</li>
<li>Quorra, Girl, obvious love interest, naive but a good fighter. Must
    be rescued at least once during the movie. Also, she is an obvious
    plot device.</li>
<li>CLUE. The computer program that, despite being born in the single,
    most complex code-base in the universe, takes his initial
    instruction literally, which makes him an asshole for some reason.</li>
<li>Rinzler, the eventual turn-coat, who does so for reasons that don't
    actually make sense, even in the goddamned TRON universe. Deus ex
    machina in a helmut. Make sure he looks like evil Stig.  - Before
    anyone bitches, yes I know that he used to be a a good guy, blah
    blah blah, but his reverting back makes no sense.</li>
<li>Zeus, a super flamboyant David Bowie knock-off who has read Alice in
    Wonderland and has upsettingly dark gay fantasies with with
    Mad Hatter. Oh also he has to turn on the users. Give him a cane,
    every flamboyant turn-coat has one.</li>
<li>Everyone else, fucking useless.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you take these characters and the plot points mentioned previously,
you will get the gist of the new TRON.</p>
<h2>More issues</h2>
<p>I wouldn't be so angry about the new TRON if it didn't look so damned
cool. Seriously, the movie is a visual orgasm of technology. The fact
that it looks so good, whilst the acting was so terrible points out just
where all the money was spent. Well, not all of the money. The rest went
to <a href="http://www.daftpunk.com/" title="Daft Punk">Daft Punk</a>, who did their
absolute damnedest to make up for the the terribly story the only way
they know how: <em>fresh beats</em>.</p>
<p><img alt="The Highlight of the
fil," src="http://wallofscribbles.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Daft-Punk-Tron-Cameo.jpg" title="Daft Punk in TRON" /></p>
<p>The music really does need some special mention here, because it was
really, very good. Not as Daft Punk-y as I was expecting, but very good
regardless. It is a soundtrack, and one I will seriously consider
purchasing. Sadly, this will cause people to ask me about the movie and
how boss I thought it was, which will lead to a similar tirade to the
one you are reading now, and will end in some awkward silence.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>TRON Legacy is a super-cool tech demo put to a bitchin' soundtrack that
was ruined by the addition of actors.</p>
<p>3/10  (7/10 if someone can make a cut that doesn't have any actors in
it)</p>
