You may, or may not have noticed some changes around here. That is, if
anyone actually reads my blog any more. I'm still working out some of
the kinks in my websites design, but all in all it's coming along quite
well. I've simplified some things; removing search; displaying one item
on the front page; moved the resume and portfolio into the blog (the
resume was its own WordPress install, and the portfolio just... didn't
exist); added a real, honest to God contact page. Things are looking up!

I'm still having a couple issues of course, that I'm trying to figure
out (mystery htaccess file issues, CSS tweaks, ) but I'm sure I can get
these figured out in the next little while. Anyways, on to things that
are important to people other than me.

<!--more-->So I've finished my first year at Mohawk College, something I
mentioned before that I had gotten into. Overall it's been a good
experience, with a couple colourful exceptions. I'm learning a lot, but
I maitain that doing additional reading on the subject of graphic design
has been a momentous help.

One part of the course that I am unimpressed with was the web coure(s).
Having been on the Internet for as long as I have (10 years, at least)
I've gained a certain amount of knowledge when it comes to web
development. Heck, my resume happens to say that I was paid to do just
that. As a result when I heard we were doing web design courses, I was
ecstatic. Then I sat in on the first web course and had one of those "oh
bugger" moments.

Now I mean no disrespect to the teacher, but I outstrip him in knowledge
hands down. As a result I ended up becoming a peer tutor on the subject.
I was the only first year peer tutor, may I add (ego stroke ahoy!).This
saddens me a great deal, because as my aim is to go into web design when
I get out of school, it's a little upsetting to know that that part of
my education is going to have to supplemented almost exclusively by the
Internet. That's never something you want to utter out loud. Trust me,
it sounds scarier.

Who knows, maybe after I graduate and see the world somewhat, I'll come
back and offer to teach the course. I'm sure I'd at least get an
interview.

The only other thing that's been irritating me was the photography
course. Photography is not an area I know much about. I understand some
of the very basics, but I can't tell you what anything on a DSLR does.
As a result I was really looking forward to the class. What I was given
was a crash course that left me with nothing to show. I am unimpressed
to say the least.

Everything else was pretty much golden. I've come out two bursaries
richer, and am sitting with a 94% average. This is basically unheard of
for me. I was a man who was happy to get a 70, and was okay with having
a 60. I never really aimed all that high when I was younger. Now? I
don't know what happened, probably the fact that I'm older, far more
jaded, and paying for it all myself. I'm not bragging or anything,
believe me when I say that it's as shocking to me as it is to others who
know me.

Also, watching TV while trying to write something is a sure-fire way to
sound like your rambling. As punishment to myself, I'm going to leave it
as is, just so I can know how terrible I am at things when the TV is
actually turned on.

Honestly I never watch the thing, so the fact that it effects me so
deeply should be understandable.

ANYWAYS, I'm off to alter my layout some more, play some Super Princess
Peach (I hate this game, but I must finish) and My World, My Way (which
borders on utterly fantastic).
