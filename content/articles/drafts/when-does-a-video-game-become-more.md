You know, I've played many games in my time here on Earth. In my youth, my household had a [Sega Master System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_System) and a beast of a [386 computer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80386 "Wikipedia - 386 processors") that came with eight whole MB of RAM. I have been playing video games literally since before I could tie my shoes, see over counter tops, or stay up past 7 PM. When I got older, I purchased my first console — an original PlayStation — which I played until the day it stopped spinning discs. I invested my own time and money into getting more games into my grubby little hands. I got my first job as a direct result of this _hunger_.

It's safe to say I'm a fan of video games.

I've played all sorts, from RPGs to sports; from puzzles to card; from strategy to the just plain weird. I'm willing to give most games a go, even though I may not have any particular preference for the genre they find themselves in. But why? What makes games so interesting to me? Why do I choose to invest so much time when I could be doing other things like sports or making friends, or really just going outside for once?

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

## The difference between good and great

I'll start by saying that not all games are created equally; that's a no-brainer, but it's as easy a launching point as any. There are a lot of bad games out there: bad writing, bad scripting, bad technology, buggy handling, complete lack of understanding of a control scheme. You name it, and there are games that are nigh unplayable as a result. This is not a unique opinion. 

There are also many games that are simply "fine." They set out to do what they wanted, and while they may have lacked grace or elegance, by god they got there. This is also not a unique opinion. A lot of people can list off bad and mediocre games; what's more is that there's always a large overlap. People tend to agree when games are bad or just ok.

Good games — and more so great games — are much harder to pin down. There are some that people can agree on (I'm told the first Assassin's Creed falls into this category), but when it comes to good and great games, opinions differ, and conversations get heated. A lot of hyperbole is thrown around. Phrases like "How can you like X? X is literally the worst game ever made." This is said directly from that person's ass, as they are talking out of it.

So I like to try and take games from a blank slate angle. I find out of something has been generally liked, but that's more or less where my use of public opinion ends. This has lead me to play some really great games, a couple good games, and a lot of mediocre to bad games. 

I define good games as ones that I play and enjoy, but once I've beaten/finished/whatever them, I put them down and never think of them again. Games like [Syndicate](http://www.ea.com/syndicate), [Deus Ex: Human Revolution](https://www.deusex.com/game/dx-hr), [Fire Emblem](http://fireemblem.nintendo.com/), [Tomb Raider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_Raider_(2013_video_game)) (The new one, not the old polygon riddled ones), [Scott Pilgrim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Pilgrim_vs._the_World:_The_Game), [Dishonored](http://www.dishonored.com/#/dishonored), [The Katamari series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katamari_Damacy), [Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons](http://www.brothersthegame.com/), the list goes on. A lot of these games were really enjoyable to play, and I can't really find fault in them. The problem is once I finished playing them I don't want to tell people about my experience playing it, other than some basic discussion. I'll never have deep, rich discourse over the merits of their writing or how they made me feel.

Great games are different. Great games stick with me long after I've stopped playing them. Great games move me; great games make me think; great games challenge me not only on a technical level, but also my thoughts and beliefs. Great games are more than the sum of their parts. For me, personally, a lot of that greatness comes from a _well-constructed story,_ in a world that has been built to support the telling of said story.

## A Story about stories

I was not a popular child growing up. I've talked about that [before]({filename}the-day-i-nearly-died.md "The Day I Nearly Died"), but to summarize: I was wildly unpopular. With few friends and a head full of low self-esteem, I found great solace in stories. On top of playing games (which I did a lot of) I was also a prolific reader. I consumed books like they were air; I read them as if my very life depended upon them. By the time I was 10, I was reading things like [The Hobbit](http://www.amazon.com/Hobbit-There-Back-Again/dp/054792822X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1372938975&sr=1-1&keywords=The+Hobbit "Amazon - The Hobbit")
and [Curse of the Shadowmage](http://www.amazon.com/Curse-Shadowmage-Forgotten-Realms-The-Harpers/dp/0786901918 "Amazon - Curse of the Shadowmage"). My escapism was obvious in retrospect, but what I notice beyond that was that I loved not only the reprieve from the real world, but the feelings the stories themselves brought out.

Like games, I've [read many books](http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1198481-corey-dutson "Goodreads.com - My Profile") in my time and I have enjoyed many, but few become favourites. I've read so many books that I've started forgetting many of them; my brain only has so much capacity and lesser books are ejected to make room for their betters. It's basically a Darwinian experiment in my memory centre.

What I personally find interesting is that to me, what makes for a great book and what makes for a great game are more or less identical. Sure, you can't rate the control scheme of a book, but an engaging story, rich characters, and a narrative that draws me in and *makes me care?* That right there is a winner. You can have terrible cover art or a rough font and I'll still read your book so long as your story is solid. The same can be said for games: they can have terrible controls, a weak soundtrack, and glaring graphical issues. I can get around those things if your story is strong enough, if you make me *care* about your story.

## So what maketh a good game, oh arbiter of taste?

Most games that have made it to my favourites list generally have a tipping point; a moment in the game wherein I forget that I'm a person playing a game, and am instead a part of the narrative. It's usually a moment of real emotion; not one of frustration at the controls or anger at the level design. I'm talking about feeling real heart break when a character dies; agonizing over a choice because I legitimately care about how it will affect the game world; smiling when two characters can come together in a real and loving way.

I'm a sucker for emotion. That said, you cannot simply put in a character death and suddenly hook me. 2-Dimensional writing, stereo-types, and over-used plot devices are commonplace in game writing. I've played enough to spot them a mile away, and when that happens I am pretty quick to check out. The number of times I've had a character die or betray me, only to have myself react with "Oh thank god, they're finally dead/gone/whatever" happens more often than it really should.

Now, I'm being critical about the writers for games, I'm aware. I know writing a good story is hard; I've only to look at some of my old attempts at fiction to see that I myself should not be throwing stones in glass metaphors. I know it's hard, and it's easy to cop-out for any number of reasons. That's totally fine. It is, I swear! The game will still be released, and many people will probably still enjoy it. I just won't be one of those people.

A good story needs more than a twist. A good story in a game is not just well-written dialogue (though that's important) or multi-dimensional characters (that's also important). It takes a well-built world wherein the actions of your avatar (as well as the actions of those around him) make sense. This is probably why I'm not a big fan of [MMO's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_game "Wikipedia - Massively multiplayer online games"). When you give so many users free reign to do whatever they want, you're going to have people break the system. That, and I've yet to play an MMO that had a deep history that you could feel. Fetch quests and assassinations do not an immersive experience make.

## Okay, so what's are some "great games," Mr. I'm-so-critical?

This is an interesting question to me, because I have a lot of games that I like. It's difficult to separate the good from the great, but I'm going to give it a whirl. The following is a (not in any way complete) list of games I have played that I consider to be "great" games. Buckle up, this next section's pretty goddamned long.

###Castle Crashers

[![Castle Crashers]({filename}../../images/when-does-a-video-game-become-more/castle-crashers.png){: class=alignright }]({filename}../../images/when-does-a-video-game-become-more/castle-crashers.png)

This one's an interesting one, because it doesn't really follow anything I wrote up above. The story is minimal, and you'll never feel immersed. That said, the world building is surprisingly deep; it's the little details in the landscapes and your interactions with the world. Your characters never say a word (in fact no one actually talks in game all that much), and yet you know what's going on. There's a real story, and as farcical as it is, you can really get into it. There's also tonnes of humour in the game, and it really ties everything together as a really enjoyable experience.

Oh, and let's not forget what a blast this game is with co-op. This game, with the addition of friends (and alcohol, if that's your thing) makes for a great evening. The first time you are forced into arena combat with your friends is always a great twist. People never know what to make of it, and they're usually the first to die.

###The Mass Effect Series

[![Mass Effect]({filename}../../images/when-does-a-video-game-become-more/Mass-Effect-3-Fem-Shep.jpg){: class=aligncenter }]({filename}../../images/when-does-a-video-game-become-more/Mass-Effect-3-Fem-Shep.jpg)

Say what you want about the ending to this game [lord knows I have]({filename}mass-effect-the-first-series-ive-ever-finished.md "Wall of scribbles - Mass Effect, the first series I've ever finished"), but it's easily one of the most compelling stories that I've ever played through. Each one in the series got me hooked over and over again.

Mass Effect pretty much ticks all the boxes for me: It's a compelling story; it has complex characters; your choices have real consequence; the list goes on. I'm not saying the games were perfect: lord knows the combat system needed some work, and the less we talk about the Mako missions, the better. What I'm saying is that despite its technical drawbacks and contentious ending, The Mass Effect series is a prime example of what you get when you have a story to tell, and you make that your focus.

It's interesting to note that I ended up buying all of the DLC for this series (minus some multiplayer content), which I would have never done had the games not drawn me in so well.

###The Walking Dead, Season 1

[![The Walking dead]({filename}../../images/when-does-a-video-game-become-more/walking-dead.jpeg){: class=aligncenter }]({filename}../../images/when-does-a-video-game-become-more/walking-dead.jpeg)

Another shining example of what you can achieve when you've got a strong narrative, powered by complex characters. I admit that this game, while offering choice, really doesn't let you go very far off the rails. It's more of an interactive graphic novel than it is a game. The writers had a plan with a couple side lines, and they made sure that you had the opportunity to experience them.

I remember it took me until nearly half way through the game before I really got hooked. I'm not sure what did it at this point, but I remember going into Episode 4 with a very different attitude. I also remember finishing the game and then going to a friends birthday party. That was not the best of ideas (I was almost an emotional wreck), but does help illustrate how powerful games can be.

An interesting thing about The Walking Dead to me is that despite a godawful game engine, the game's narrative is so compelling that you can look beyond the not infrequent juttering that plagues the game.

###Borderlands & Borderlands 2

[![Borderlands]({filename}../../images/when-does-a-video-game-become-more/borderlands.jpg){: class=aligncenter }]({filename}../../images/when-does-a-video-game-become-more/borderlands.jpg)

Why Corey, aren't there other entries in the Borderlands series? Why yes! Yes there are! But there's two things with that:

- I have not yet played Tales of the Borderlands, so I cannot make any judgements about it. It may or may not be as good as the ones in this sub-title.
- Borderlands the Pre-Sequel is not good. There's a whole article to write about that eventually (I'll finish it one day, I'm sure), but this is a game wherein They took some of the worst parts of the previous game, and just added to them. You hated driving the vehicles? Well here's some more that you _have_ to use. What, is running around killing things not challenging enough for you? Well how about we force you to have to run to oxygen pockets scattered throughout the map? What? We'll let you but bounce!

Seriously, I cannot state enough how disappointed I am in Pre-sequel.

Anyways, Borderlands and Borderlands 2 were fantastic games in spite of their somewhat questionable mechanics. The balancing was off, the vehicles were terrible to drive, and it was not absent of bugs and exploits. What hooked me about Borderlands/2 was the writing and character design. Even when characters were utterly 2-Dimensional, they had such strong (and in most cases hilarious) writing that you couldn't help but like them.

These are also games that did DLC better than most. All the purchasable items of DLC added 10 hours (on average) per addition. What's more is that they felt like the same level of care was put into them as there was with the main titles. That's rare to see.

###Thief 1 and Thief 2

[![Thief]({filename}../../images/when-does-a-video-game-become-more/Thief-The-Dark-Project.jpg){: class=aligncenter }]({filename}../../images/when-does-a-video-game-become-more/Thief-The-Dark-Project.jpg)

The original Thief games are fan-goddamned-tastic. Graphically they hold up about as well as wet toilet paper, but those games have some of the best world-building that I've ever seen. There is a deep and established history within the stories of Thief. The voice work is top notch, the stories themselves twist and turn, and they were both games with as many ways to complete missions as there was about making sure any way you chose to do so would have it's challenges.

I can remember as a younger man playing and re-playing the demo level of Thief 2 over and over. Each time trying different methods of interaction. I'd play through without ever being seen, another where I knocked everyone and their mother out to rob them blind. Other times I was a murderous angel, sticking everything that moves with arrows.

The ability to re-play this game in various ways (a trait lost on the later games), was staggering, and really helped make your thief experience that much more personal. If you can struggle through the roughly 57 polygons that were used to make the models, you should play them. You won't regret it.

### FEZ

[![FEZ]({filename}../../images/when-does-a-video-game-become-more/Fez.png){: class=aligncenter }]({filename}../../images/when-does-a-video-game-become-more/Fez.png)

Putting aside the fact that the games' creator, Phil Fish, is an asshole, FEZ is a fucking phenomenal game. Mechanically, FEZ is a very simple game: It's a 2D platformer with a 3-dimensional twist (that's a joke for anyone who's actually played FEZ). 

FEZ has almost on dialogue, and the story is almost entirely passive: you have to collect some cubes to fix the world you live in from glitching out. You need to collect x amount to "beat" the game. That's the most straight-forward way to play the game, and also the worst.

There is so much history in FEZ if you go looking for it. The world-building alone must have taken _years_ of thought and experimentation to get right. There's a custom language that you can decipher, some 4th wall breaking research, There are time-sensitive (minute/hour/day/week/month/ etc) puzzles that you could walk right by if you weren't looking. Hell there's even a way to get the game to go stereoscopic, allowing you to wear 3d glasses to _make the game 3D_.

What's more about FEZ is that it takes at least 3 play-throughs to get most of the content. It's a crazy rich game. You should play it.

### Bioshock

[![Bioshock]({filename}../../images/when-does-a-video-game-become-more/bioshock.jpg){: class=aligncenter }]({filename}../../images/when-does-a-video-game-become-more/bioshock.jpg)

You want world-building? You want well-written characters? You want to have the poop scared out of you on a semi-regular basis? Bioshock is the game you are looking for. 

There's so much I've already said about [Bioshock]({filename}bioshock.md "Wall of Scribbles - Bioshock"), so I'm not going to wax poetic about it here. Bioshock is a great game in almost every way. It's beautiful game with some fantastic writing; it hooks you early and drags you down to the bottom of the ocean. You cannot help but invested in the characters in this game. Hell, regardless of whether you play as a 'good' or 'bad' character, the writing really works to support you either way. 

The game itself is pretty solid as well. Other than more back-tracking than is strictly neccessary, the technical mechanics of Bioshock are pretty swell. It plays like a great game, and it feels like a lot of work went into making the experience the best it could be.

### Bastion

[![Bastion]({filename}../../images/when-does-a-video-game-become-more/Bastion.jpg){: class=aligncenter }]({filename}../../images/when-does-a-video-game-become-more/Bastion.jpg)

First: Bastion is a beautiful game to look at. Second: the music is truly next-level. Third: it's such a solid game to _play._

Bastion's an interesting one in that you start with no idea what is going on. The world is literally built up around you while you play. You're a silent protagonist, and the world-building and the lore is left to a narrator whom you actually get to meet. He talks about what you're doing as you're doing it, and it's a very interesting change to the usual modal. Most games give you story between missions or during down-time. Bastion changes that modal with it's fly-by-wire narration.

There's also a lot of customization available, not in any way that will change the course of the game, but in a way that makes your in-game home feel a bit more like your own. It helps build up your experience and make it a bit more personal.

### Sam n' Max: Hit the Road

[![Sam n Max visit the Freak show]({filename}../../images/when-does-a-video-game-become-more/sam-n-max.gif){: class=alignleft }]({filename}../../images/when-does-a-video-game-become-more/sam-n-max.gif)

A classic from Lucas Arts, Sam n' Max are some of the most enjoyable characters from the classic adventure era of games. An era that ended too soon, in my humble opinion. The story is insane, the characters are indescribably weird, and the art direction is, in my opinion, inspired. I argue that this game may be one of the best Point-and-click adventure games ever made.

While you're not going to be drawn in by any deep story of heartbreak or revenge, you cannot help but be enamoured with Sam n' Max. As you explore the world around you, delight and absurdity greet you every step of the way. The fact that the main villain is an England-born country singing super star, while the main protagonists are a dog that dresses in a suit and an utterly psychotic rabbit... well it's hard not to have fun in this universe.

Then there's the writing and voice acting, which are both just _on point._ I honestly could not tell you a single voice actor in the game, but they performed their jobs admirably.

If you can get a copy to run on your computer, you need to experience this game. Oh, and don't forget to pick up the in-game mini-games: Carbomb, the coloring book, and the dressup game.

## Some honourable mentions

So I decided to add this section to give some attention to some good games that just don't quite make it into my greats category. I'm not going to dedicate huge blocks of text to them, but they do deserve at least an mention:

- **[Stacking](http://www.stackingvideogame.com/):** An adorable game by double fine productions. Lots of neat puzzles and a really cute world. Lots of character, but too short, and the story itself is... well it's not bad, but it's not all that great either.

- **[Costume Quest](http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Product/Costume-Quest/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d80258410a79):** Another game by double fine productions. Almost the same things to say as Stacking, honestly. The Puzzles are a lot easier, but the whole vibe I got from it was very "baby's first RPG." Now that's not bad, but it got grating after a while.

- **[L.A. Noire](http://www.rockstargames.com/lanoire/):** A beautiful Rocksteady game with a lot of great technology behind it. I loved the noire feeling they went for, but a couple weird plot holes and their method of depicting female characters was ham-fisted to say the least. I'm all for faith to a genre, but good grief, come on Rocksteady.

- **[Batman: Arkham Asylum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_Arkham_Asylum) & [Batman: Arkham City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_Arkham_City):** Oh how I love Batman, and oh how I loved _being_ Batman. As much as I loved these games as well as their writing and technical systems, they left something to be desired. I found Asylum too short in some ways, but too long in others. City was great, but the challenges were dry, and traversing the City became tedious once the shine wore off.

- **[All of the Professor Layton games](http://professorlayton.nintendo.com/):** I've talked about the Professor Layton games before. I actually stopped writing reviews for them because honestly they're all the same at this point: The prof and Luke get sucked into bonkers plot-line; They get real deep in and it almost seems real; The Professor pulls some bullshit deus ex machina and saves the day, proving it all had a logical explanation. Oh, and there are like a billion puzzles. I may sound critical, but I've bought every one of those fucking games, and I will continue to do so. They're just not for everyone.

- **[All of the Phoenix Wright games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Wright:_Ace_Attorney):** The Phoenix Wright games are basically the Professor Layton games, but with less puzzles, and more twists. Solving court-cases shouldn't be as much fun as this game makes them out to be, but if this was how lawyers got to do their job, you'd have a lot more people applying. That said, they're not for everyone as the game can get a bit grind-y especially if you've not got a clue as to what's expected of you. A lot of trial and error really take away from these games.

- **[Earthbound](http://earthbound.nintendo.com/):** Ask anyone I know, and they'll tell you how much I love this game. It's a really solid game. It's a JRPG without all the visual trappings of a JRPG. Sadly this game bombed in the US due to a terrible effort at advertising. The reason this game isn't on the great list is that for as much as I love it, this game has problems. The plot is paper thin, the characters are flat (literally and figuratively), and it's an old-school RPG, which is a nice way of saying you'll have to grind like a bro in a nightclub to get the levels you need to win. If you want to play it, it's on the WiiU virtual console store.

- **[Final Fantasy VII](http://www.finalfantasyviipc.com/en):** Another game that I love that really does not hold up well over time. The characters are a hot mess of polygons, the writing is wooden (though from what I've read, that's more a translation issue), and it can be very grind-heavy at times. It's not for everyone. That said, I've beaten the game at least 3 times, and I enjoy it every time. You should have seen my giddy excitement when I found out that they are actually making a remake for the PS4.

- **[Gone Home](http://www.gonehomegame.com/):** I was really late to playing this game. I only played it about 6 weeks ago, and it's been out since 2013. Gone home is not so much as game, as it is a house simulator with a story told over top of it. That may sound boring, but the creators put a lot of work into making the house really feel lived-in. What's more is that your characters' sister's story is both so very common and at the same time unique. I _did_ feel like I was going to be attacked by zombies throughout the entire game, which was a bit of a drag.

And that's all I've got to say about that.
