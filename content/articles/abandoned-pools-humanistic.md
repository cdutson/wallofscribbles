Just to clarify: Abandoned Pools is a project by Tommy Walter and though
I am unaware of the bands history, I am sure there were at some point or
another other band members. As of right now it is just him, making this
effectively a one-man- fronted band.

Anyways back to the CD.

Humanistic is a rather dark-feeling album, despite the happy overtones
some of the songs portray. Granted some just put it right out there such
as *Monster* and *Blood*, whereas others are more subtle (*Start Over*
and *Never* come to mind.) Many of the songs feature layers of
instruments, giving it a grungy feel that could rake at peoples ears if
they crank the volume too high, so be warned. I should also add that
listening to this album tents to turn me into an overly reflective
state, much like a "coming to terms with shit" sort of feel. It's
comforting in a way, which is probably what I love most about this
album. It's got a resolve to it that just strikes a chord or five in
myself.

As I stated already, many of the tracks feature layers of instruments.
This does mean there was probably a lot of post-production done to the
album to get the sound where Tommy wanted it. Some people turn their
noses at this practice, stating that they'll be no good live. I can't
vouch for Abandoned Pools, having never seen them live (though I would
if I could) but the sound of these songs is easily some of the best I've
heard. They don't seem over-done or really treated. It's more like he
put each layer on, one by one, and did each instrument over; hitting a
symbol once during the whole song just to get that moment right. A lot
of effort can be heard in these.

The only issue I have with the CD is the occasional use of the
"announcer" voice. I don't know its official name, but that voice that
sounds like its from a 1960's cold war video. I hate it in ANY song, not
just the ones featured here. I will say that it takes away from what
would otherwise be a truly solid album.

I'd suggest at least giving this album a listen, though I can say that
it's not going to be for everyone. It's a little dark, and a little
moody, but it's a solid listen from start to finish. I've had this album
at least 5 years and I'm still in love with it.

9/10
