        <p>Yeah so I sort of didn't post at all for like, 5 weeks. Amazing how time
passes when you're busy as hell during the end of days. I've been doing
assignments and working and flying across the world and playing some
games and learning Japanese and probably some other stuff. Yeah, I guess
you could say that I've been a touch on the busy side.</p>
<p>Such is the life of a student.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>First off, I've become a Peer Tutor at my school. Not only
does it land me some extra cash (always a bonus, given the current
financial psudo-crisis I am finding myself in), but it's additional work
experience, and I get to help people. It could come to a shock to some,
but I actually do enjoy helping others when they are willing to take it.
I happen to be the web design specialist, and I think I'm the busiest
tutor of the bunch. Not that the others don't work, but I've helped a
good amount of people by now.</p>
<p>Not that I'm complaining about that.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I landed myself a trip to Japan that happened half way through
March. I don't have my pictures up or even accessible at this point, but
when I get them I'll be sure to dump them on the website and make
everyone jealous. Let me just say that Japan is a brilliant place that I
would visit again at the drop of a hat; it's clean, it's pretty, it's
polite, it's so short. There are Shinto shrines in their outdoor
shopping areas; just in case you need a blessing or two before you drop
some Yen. My <a href="http://www.danielkukwa.com">friend</a> has a

If you're curious, have a look.</p>
<p>Ironically it was this trip that got me back into learning Japanese (one
of my silly life goals.) I've wanted to ever since I was a young kid
into anime, and though I don't watch anime very much anymore, the desire
to learn the language remains.</p>
<p>Of course, by leaving for a week, I had a weeks worth of assignments to
catch up on, as well as a loss in time for any assignments that had due
dates in the future. It's not a joke when I say that within a day of my
return, I was doing assignments like it was going out of style. By the
time Wednesday (landed 11:45 on Friday) had rolled around, I had
finished 5. by Friday, I had 9 done. I was very burnt out by the time I
was caught up, let me tell you.</p>
<p>During my flight, I finished <a href="http://www.ace-attorney.com/" title="Ace Attorney">Apollo
Justice</a> (review coming
this Thursday) and picked up <a href="http://na.square-enix.com/frontmission/" title="Square Enix: Front Mission">Front
Mission</a>
for the DS again. I have successfully finished the first <em>half</em> of the
game, and I've givin at least 30 hours of my life to it. The second half
is even harder, apparently. I await the many Game Over screens with
glee. It's not as robust as the Play Station variations, but it's still
as mind-bendingly difficult. It's not uncommon for battles to last over
an hour. Never mind the down time when you are buying equipment and
running through the arena to make enough money to upgrade everyone.</p>
<p>Ugh. I'm never going to play it again once I've defeated it. It's a game
I can live with never picking up again.</p>
<p>get_leader</p>
<p>I can't remember if I mentioned it or not, But I've actually also picked
up the new <a href="http://na.square-enix.com/starocean/" title="Square Enix: Star Ocean - The Last Hope">Star
Ocean</a>.
It's got a pretty quick learning curve, and it's just as difficult as
the previous versions were. Seriously, <em>two hours</em> between save points?
This was a good design process? Well at least they droped the 'MP Death'
from this version. What a terrible idea <em>that</em> was.The graphics are
solid, the game-play is too. My only major issues with it are the fact
that it wants to be widescreen, and so the menus are slightly cut off on
my TV, and the voice acting.</p>
<p>Oh God, the voice acting. It's terrible. seriously, it's like they went
to an acting school, found the people who were the bottom of the class,
and threw them all into a recording studio with 15 minutes to read the
script. It's utterly terrible. Really makes the (many) cut scenes that
much more painful.</p>
<p>I've also picked up <a href="http://www.alienhominid.com/" title="Alien Hominid">Alien
Hominid</a>,
<a href="http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/games/media/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d80258410840/" title="Xbox.com: Carcassonne">Carcassonne</a>,
and <a href="http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/games/media/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d8025841083c/" title="Xbox.com: Aegis Wing">Aegis
Wing</a>
for the 360. Here are my brief rundowns of them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Carcassonne</strong>: I recently fell in love with Carcassonne at a
    friends house, so that was a required purchase. I'm sure I will come
    to hate it like Settlers of Catan.</li>
<li><strong>Aegis Wing:</strong> it's a free download, and was made by the Microsoft
    Intern Team (3 guys). I'll let that stand on it's own. It's free,
    at least.</li>
<li><strong>Alien Hominids</strong>: <a href="/2009/02/05/castle-crashers/" title="WallOfScribbles.com: Castle Crashers">I'm a big
    fan</a>
    of <a href="http://www.castlecrashers.com/" title="Castle Crashers">Castle
    Crashers</a>, so I
    opted to pick up Beheamoths first game while it's on the cheap - 50%
    off - and try it out. The first 4 minutes of the game proved to me
    just how much more pollished Castle Crashers is. I'm already not a
    fan of Alien Hominids, but I'll at least give it the ol'
    college try.</li>
</ul>
<p>If anyone wants to friend me on the 360, my tag is "Jack Dutson" and
feel free to do so.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I work at Shoppers Drugmart, quit working at the Revolution
Night Club in Kitchener - didn't agree with the direction management was
going - and I'm working on a sweet redesign of my resublogfolio.When I
can find time to finish and slice it, It'll be pretty sweet.</p>
<p>So that's the last month summed up, here's hoping I can post with a
little more regularity for the coming months!</p>
