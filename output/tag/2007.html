            <p>Anyone who has talked to me about DS games will inevitably find out that
I am a complete fanboy when it comes to what I call "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_Attorney" title="Wikipedia: Ace Attorney">The Lawyer
Games</a>."
This catchall title is used when talking about any of the Phoenix Wright
or Apollo Justice games. I've talked about

<a href="/2008/01/14/phoenix-wright-justice-for-all-capcom-2007" title="WallOfScribbles.com: Phoenix Wright: Justice For All">installments</a>
of the series, and so now that I find myself with a little time
(shockingly) I thought that I should probably get off my ass and get to
writing! Self-deprecating aside, I've always enjoyed the Ace Attorney
series, but I honestly found this one to be a little lost. Well, a
little lost until the end when the grand machinations of the writers
come to fruition.</p>

is very much like the original, but with a few added tricks. Released in
North America January of 2007, Current fans salivated over the new game.
Featuring slightly improved graphics, - maybe I'm nuts but I don't
recall moving mouths in the first game - slightly better music, an
expanded cast, and a new feature to aggravate the player, Justice For
All provides hours of entertaining Lawyer-y fun.</p>
<p>The downside to the game right off the bat is that there are only four
cases, unlike the original version which had five. Other than that, this
game features many subtle improvements that should not be overlooked.
For starters the cases featured are much longer, and in ...</p>

            <p>Over the Christmas holidays, Theresa and I went to our local

theater</a>, and
watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0467406/" title="Juno">Juno</a>. I have to
say that it's easily one of the best films I watched in 2007. It was
sweet, funny, and potent in all the right spots.</p>
<p>The movie Juno is about one Juno MacGuff (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0680983/" title="Ellen Page">Ellen
Page</a>) and Paulie
Bleeker (the ever master of awkward pauses, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0148418/" title="Michael Cera">Michael
Cera</a>) and their
joint child-making. The movie takes place during the nine months of
Juno's wonderful adventure through pregnancy, and her interaction with
the adoptive couple Vanessa and Mark Loring (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004950/" title="Jennifer Garner">Jennifer

Legend</a> staring Will
Smith. The premise of the movie is that Robert Neville (Will Smith) is
the last man alive, after a deadly super-virus lays waste to 90% of the
worlds population. 1% of man kind had a natural immunity to it, and
9%... well that's something else.</p>
<p>A little slow and pointless off the bat, it feels very typical for the
first 20 minutes or so. Once it has been established that, yes, he is
the only guy around, it gets to the good parts. I shouldn't paint it so
negatively, because I Am Legend does a wonderful job of building
tension. I mean, you know shits ...</p>

            <p>Beowulf is the newest adaptation do the epic poem of yore. It's rather
liberal with its interpretation, and as near as I can tell, also adds

<p>I tried to watch this movie, and take it seriously. Honestly I did, and
I am sorry to everyone who was around me who was also trying to watch
the movie seriously. I didn't mean to laugh at it so much, I really
didn't! But when a man is naked for over half of the film, has

            <p>The concept of the book is pretty straight forward: Nameless asshole guy
goes throughout his life, and it's narrated in first person so you get
all of his thoughts as they go. You also get to read about his having
sex, wanting to have sex, jerking off, wishing to jerk off, or some sort
of combination of all the previous activities for about 60% of the book.
This may sound like a pathetic excuse for a novel, but if you take all
the satire out of it, you will realize that guys think about sex on a
near-unhealthy amount. The narrator continues to document his life and
lusts as his relationship falls apart around him and a new one ...</p>

<p>The synopsis is not something I can easily go through and so I shall
keep it short. Roger is a pathetic excuse for a man who is in his 40's
and working at Staples. Bethany is a girl who's a bit too old to be a
Goth with no real direction in life. She too works at Staples. They
connect through their writing each other notes. Nothing romantic in
them, but a connection is forged. And that is the simple yet stunning
basis of the book. From there it is a whirlwind ...</p>

            <p>Much of the movie revolves around the Vietnam War, and the protests that
went on during the time. All the characters are pulled into differing
sub-cultures and left to their own devices, and are let to play out
their lives with what they've gotten themselves into. It demonstrates
what people are capable of when they feel the need to work for
something. It displays people in their best and worst moments without
much in the ways of compromise, and shows that people aren't perfect nor
do situations always work out glowing. It does glaze over one or two
areas that probably could have had more explaining, but you cannot
