        <blockquote>
<p>When a dad beats up his daughter, he does not necessarily go to jail.
But when a guy beats up a dad for beating up his daughter, they both
go to jail. It is very confusing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perry's Gram used to say that the L in his name stood for 'Lucky', and
he is just that. While playing the lottery, which he did every week,
Perry finds himself 12 million dollars richer. Now everyone wants to be
his friend, his family, who never talked to him otherwise, wants him to
hand it over to a family trust.</p>
<p>Perry, with the guidance (of a sort) of Gram, his friend Keith, his boss
Gary, and Cherry the Convenience store clerk, Perry slowly works to
improve his life. He starts working through his lottery list which
includes a big tv, a trip to Hawaii, Fixing up Yo (Keiths beaten up
Toyota Truck), and so on.</p>
<p>He starts moving up at his job (a local fishing store) by giving good
advice to the owner, and helping the sales grow. He gains respect from
those he works with, as well as the locals. As his family applies more
and more pressure on Perry, he decides what to do with the money.</p>
<p>I didn't like the writing style of this book. I tried and I tried, and
even now the writing still bugs me. I know it's supposed to be written
as a narrative from Perry, but it's just so ... simple. Things are
repeated multiple times, the sentences are short and mundane, and there
are no less than a bajillion references to "they would not like that." I
refuse to explain that further. If you read the book, you'll know what
I'm talking about. The chapters are short and much of the story is …
boring. There's a lot of filler in which the nuggets have to shine
through in order to be recognized.</p>
<p>Having said all that, I enjoyed Lottery. It's not ground-breaking, nor
will it win any awards in my book. It isn't going on my favorites list
by any means, but I liked it all the same. It's a real underdog
feel-good everyone gets theirs sort of story that you just want to read
sometimes. It made me laugh, it made my sad, and it made me smile. It
hooked me by the end, and that's the important part. Once I got past the
fluff, there was a really good story beneath it all.</p>
<p>If you're in the mood for an underdog book, this is the one to read.
Everyone gets what they deserve, it makes you warm and fuzzy on the
inside, and it comes with one of the best hedgestone message ever:
"Don't be smart"</p>
