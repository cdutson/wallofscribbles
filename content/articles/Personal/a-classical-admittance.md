Recently, I found an all-classical FM station broadcasting out of
Toronto that I can actually listen to in Brantford, Cambridge, and
Kitchener-Waterloo. This may not sound like anything impressive - who
even listens to FM radio anymore - but if you have ever tried to listen
to Toronto-based radio in those areas, you would know what I'm talking
about. There is something about this strip of land that just destroys
radio signals.

Regardless, since I've found this station, I have yet to change it back
to the others that I listen to. [Classical
96.3FM](http://www.classical963fm.com/ "Classical 96.3FM") does an
amazing job of not only featuring brilliant classical music, past and
present, but also features spots like "Sunday night at the Opera", "The
Greatest Music Of All Time..." and spoken poetry. How can you not love
this?

Though I feel their website could use a little information architecture
- It's rather busy and cramped in some places- they offer a surprising
amount of content for a radio station website. They have an online
listening section as the Internet radio is all the rage now, and even
the "[What Was That
Piece](http://www.classical963fm.com/node/15 "Classical 96.3FM: What was that piece?")"
list: a minute to minute feature of every song they've played throughout
the day and the entire week previous.

I must also mention that though they play the typical classical music,
they also feature some fantastic choice music, moving opera pieces, and
even arrangements from movies (Lord of the Rings, Forest Gump, and Star
Trek to name a few). I actually got home and sat in my car for an
additional 6 minutes to listen to the end of Misere Me, Deus by <span
class="italics">Gregorio Allegri, a moving choir piece. The best part is
that I have no idea who that is yet, but thanks to the station and their
website, I can find out.</span>

If you're in the mood for some audible culture, Classical 96.3FM is a
station to tune into. If you aren't in the Toronto area, attach yourself
to their [Internet radio
player](http://www.classical963fm.com/player "Classical 96.3FM: Internet Player").

P.S. be warned: All of the personallities they have working there can
hypnotise you with their voice. Every damned one.
