I did these a couple weeks ago with the idea of doing a whole series of
them. I still might, actually. In any case, I give you [2.0
Wallpapers.](/wallpapers/?album=7&gallery=22 "2.0 Wallpapers") They're
all in 1280 x 1024 format, but You can shrink 'em down if you're really
feeling it.

And with that I am going to lay down, because my head feels like it's
about to explode.

Yes I'm aware that this is a bit of a cop-out post, but I made a [bonus
one on Friday](/2008/03/07/thanks-sharepoint/ "Thanks SharePoint") so
that's my excuse.

G'night.
