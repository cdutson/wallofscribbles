So hey, you know babies? Turns out that they poop. Like a lot. Like multiple times a day. Babies poop like they've eaten nothing but curry paste and ex-lax. Babies poop like they're in some kind of hotdog-eating competition, but in this case the hotdogs are poop, and the eating is pooping. Baby's poop like they don't give a fuck. You know why? Because they're babies and they don't even have a concept of giving a fuck.

I've have got to work on my metaphors. And my similes.

So full disclosure: this post is basically about baby poop. It's got some poop-adjacent discussion, but it's at least 50% - 60% poop. Skip it or strap in, cause I'm numb to it all now and I'm not sure where the rest of the world is with this stuff. It's not all negative though, I swear.

## This is the part where he talks about poop

[![Babby]({filename}../../images/sunlight-and-poopy-pants/babby.jpg){: class=alignleft }]({filename}../../images/sunlight-and-poopy-pants/babby.jpg) Everyone who's had kids will tell you that baby poop is an adventure all its own. Heck, my daughter's only 4 months old and I know that shit's gonna get weirder as she gets older. 

Yeah, puns and swearing and poop all in one. That's where we are now. That's what's happening.

My daughter's not even on solid foods yet, so god help me when that happens. I'm sure there'll be another post about this another couple months. In it I'll be chuckling at the poor, naive chap writing this post. "_**You have no idea, you ignorant man!**_" he will yell into the past. He will be secure in the knowledge that past him will never hear it.

Where was I? Oh right, poop. Specifically baby poop. Baby poop is weird, man. And I'm not talking about those first fresh couple hospital/home care/whatever poops. I'm not talking about Meconium, or the weird pilling poops or anything like that. I'm talking about the "cheap street curry yellow" poop phase. 

Sometimes it smells, sometimes it doesn't. Sometime's it's green, sometimes it's yellow. Sometimes there's a whole bunch, sometimes it's all sound and thunder signifying nothing. Sometimes it's an easy clean up, and sometimes you are sticking wipes into places that you never thought you'd ever have to clean on a human.

Honestly after the first week or two, you become utterly desensitized to it all. I've gotten it on my hands, my clothes, once actually on my face that I was never able to figure out how. You grab yourself a wet-wipe and you soldier on.

## Still talking about poop.

"Why the hell is he talking about this?", you've got to be wondering at this point. If you're not, than you're more into this than I am but whatever turns your metaphorical crank. I'm talking about this because to some folks, it's just something you wipe off your kids nethers and toss away. If that's you, than cool, cool, cool. The next part of this post won't matter to you, but the last bit might. I'd add a jump link, but you can scroll and I'm lazy. 

Cmd/Ctrl+F Sunlight. Or scroll, like I told you.

My wife and I made the decision to use cloth diapers for our daughter. I could tout that it's better for the environment and such (apparently it is), but the honest truth is that it's a helluva lot cheaper to do the reusable cloth diapers than it is to buy the disposables. Well, I guess that depends on how much you value your time, cause scrubbing diapers does indeed take time. It also depends on whether you plan on having a second child or not. Cloth diapers really start to show their ROI after the first child. 

## Cloth Diapers: they're cool again. I guess.

[![Rumparooz are effective and stylish]({filename}../../images/sunlight-and-poopy-pants/rumparooz.jpg){: class=alignright }]({filename}../../images/sunlight-and-poopy-pants/rumparooz.jpg) We did our research and eventually decided on [Kengacare's Rumparooz](http://www.kangacare.com/Rumparooz-One-Size-Cloth-Diaper.html). They get great reviews; they're super flexible in sizing; they have a removable soaker (important); they biodegrade in a landfill (also important); and they look super snazzy to boot (less important but still nice). What really sold us was watching a couple how-to videos (such as [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0ppdB7wVYc)) that showed how easy they were to use.

We've also got a couple of the [bumGenius Cloth diapers](http://www.toysrus.ca/product/index.jsp?productId=28918546) from Babies r us that also work, but we're not as stoked about.

As if one could really get stoked about cloth diapers.

The Kengacare diapers work really well. We've not had one leak yet, and by god has our daughter put them through a trial by fire. The bumGenius ones work fine, but since they're all-in-one it makes cleaning them more awkward than I'd like. They do have a line of bumGenius diapers that have removable inserts, but we've not tried them, so I cannot speak to their ease of use nor ability. 

If you're wondering, I do most of the cleaning of the diapers. I do most of said cleaning whilst in the shower. It's just easier, and I'm well past whatever judgement I may have once felt about it. If you're wondering why: it's just how things shook out. My daughter is attached to my wife due to her refusal to take a bottle (that's a post all on it's own), and so I'm the one with more free time to help out in other ways. In this case, it's poop-wrangling.

Here's the thing about cloth diapers: you can't just hose 'em off and toss them in a hamper. For one: they'd smell awful cause, you know, poop (and let's not forget urine, cause that reeks as well); for two: unless you are constantly doing laundry, those bad boys are just gonna sit there (that's bad); and for three: that butt-curry your baby's pushin' stains like turmeric.

We've found that despite rinsing them and washing poop-laden articles of clothing (because poop goes beyond just the diaper) we were unable to actually remove the stains. I'm sure we could bleach them out of the white stuff, but what about the rest? We assumed that the clothes were just stained for life, and that's how things roll.

Enter stage left: Sunlight.

## Sunlight, saviour of the cloth

[![Sunlight to the rescue]({filename}../../images/sunlight-and-poopy-pants/sunlight-bar.jpg){: class=alignleft }]({filename}../../images/sunlight-and-poopy-pants/sunlight-bar.jpg) Now I'm not talking about actual sunlight: rays of light that come from our fire-y sky-orb. I'm talking about [Sunlight soap bars](http://www.amazon.ca/Sunlight-Lemon-Laundry-Detergent-Gram/dp/B003Y7OB1A). My mother-in-law introduced us to them, and like most savvy customers I was skeptical. She showed me the results, and I opted to test them myself at home. Also she gave us some free bars so what the hell, right?

Now I should state that I don't consider myself a brand whore (he says typing away on his macbook, while his iPad and iPhone charge near by, and the mac mini attached to the nearby tv lays in wait). I'm not one to simply take a recommendation and die on that hill. I am, however, open to suggestions on how the hell to remove the permanent yellow that had etched its' way into my daughters clothes and diapers.

Holy shit, people. I've never gone from skeptical to convert for a product in so short a time. The sunlight bars absolutely demolish the stains. Even ones that had been through the wash a couple times. We thought we would have to toss the clothing, and instead we got to use it one more week until our daughter grew way too fast.

Seriously. These sunlight bars are _fantastic._ I cannot stress this enough. They remove all signs of poop from clothing as well as the diapers. The only thing they have _any_ trouble with are the soakers themselves. Sunlight seems to be able to remove 90% of any stain in a soaker, but just can't get that last little bit. I assume it has something to do with the materials made to construct them. If it becomes a huge problem, we can always bleach the soakers and then wash em a couple times to make sure they're safe to use.

I should say that yes, even though I spot-treat the diapers to remove the perpetual poop stains, I still toss them in the washing machine for a good, proper wash. Seems to work out pretty well. As a bonus, the Sunlight bars do remove the stains from the bumGenius diapers pretty much perfectly. Anything that didn't come out from the spot Sunlighting gets removed when we throw them in the wash after.

## Please stop talking about poop now. Please?

That about covers it. Cloth diapers are a lifestyle choice, like kambucha or crossfit; baby poop stains like the ink packs they put in piles of money to deter bank-robbers; and sunlight bars are flippin' amazing at removing poop stains from tiny human clothes.

I don't begrudge anyone that does disposable diapers, but if you're gonna go cloth, I hope my post helps you in some way. At the very least I hope you found it entertaining.

Poop. Poop, poop, poop, poop, poop.

Poop.
