            <p>What to say about
<a href="http://www.blindness-themovie.com/" title="Blindness The Movie">Blindness</a>? I
went and saw it with Theresa when It came out in Canada (October 3rd, if
anyone is wondering). We had seen previews for it months ago, and the
idea intregued us both. At that point it fell off the map to anyone who
wasn't actively trying to follow it.</p>
<p>Apparently it was shown at the Cannes film festival to mixed reception.
Reading reviews online does little to ease ones trepidation towards the
film. It seems that Blindness is a movie that has those who love it, and
others that feel that it was "<span class="story_body"><a href="http://www.filmthreat.com/index.php?section=reviews&amp;Id=11233" title="Blindness: reviewed">like looking
into the sky and having sand poured into your

Nines</a>. I'm not
even sure whether I liked it or not. Theresa and I watched it this
afternoon, and It was going well right up until the end. Then I didn't
know what the hell was going on.</p>
<p>I apologize in advance, but in order to review this movie, there are
going to be spoilers.</p>
<p>The Nines is a 3-story story about Gary/Gavin/Gabe - "G" from here on in
- who are all portrayed by Ryan Reynolds. The stories seem to be roughly
fitted around each other (the first two far more than the last) and as
they unfold they have the repeating themes of "intro, progress, get

            <p>Over the Christmas holidays, Theresa and I went to our local
<a href="http://www.princesscinemas.com/" title="Princess Cincemas">independent movie
theater</a>, and
watched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0467406/" title="Juno">Juno</a>. I have to
say that it's easily one of the best films I watched in 2007. It was
sweet, funny, and potent in all the right spots.</p>
<p>The movie Juno is about one Juno MacGuff (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0680983/" title="Ellen Page">Ellen
Page</a>) and Paulie
Bleeker (the ever master of awkward pauses, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0148418/" title="Michael Cera">Michael
Cera</a>) and their
joint child-making. The movie takes place during the nine months of
Juno's wonderful adventure through pregnancy, and her interaction with
the adoptive couple Vanessa and Mark Loring (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004950/" title="Jennifer Garner">Jennifer
Garner</a> and

that I've ever seen, but the movie uses ...</p>

Legend</a> staring Will
Smith. The premise of the movie is that Robert Neville (Will Smith) is
the last man alive, after a deadly super-virus lays waste to 90% of the
worlds population. 1% of man kind had a natural immunity to it, and
9%... well that's something else.</p>
<p>A little slow and pointless off the bat, it feels very typical for the
first 20 minutes or so. Once it has been established that, yes, he is
the only guy around, it gets to the good parts. I shouldn't paint it so
negatively, because I Am Legend does a wonderful job of building
tension. I mean, you know shits ...</p>

            <p>Beowulf is the newest adaptation do the epic poem of yore. It's rather
liberal with its interpretation, and as near as I can tell, also adds
new and unrelated sections to the plot.</p>
<p>I tried to watch this movie, and take it seriously. Honestly I did, and
I am sorry to everyone who was around me who was also trying to watch
the movie seriously. I didn't mean to laugh at it so much, I really
didn't! But when a man is naked for over half of the film, has
questionable (at best) dialog, and so much over the top fighting that a
Die Hard fan would squeel with joy... well it's just too much for ...</p>

            <p><span style="padding: 4px; float: right"></span> I had the chance to
watch this movie at about 3 in the morning after Theresa suffered a
horrible coughing fit (she developed a cough while at school). She
decided to put a movie on since she has this amazing habit to fall
asleep to any movie she sets her mind to. I sadly do not have the same
ability. In fact I could go so far as to say that if a movie is being
played, I'll be drawn to it like a moth to the flame, regardless of the
quality of the movie. All it takes is one hook and it's over.</p>

            <p>On the weekend I went out with Theresa and four others (sister, roomie,
and the boyfriends) to one of the only things to do in North Bay. You
really only get four options: Drink, have sex, go to the mall, or go to
the movies. Well you can mix and match those, but that's basically it.
Regardless, we went to the movies.</p>
<p>This is where I saw Good Luck Chuck.</p>
<p>Now I've heard people saying that either it was good, or it sucked
dirty, smelly anus. The bell curve for this movie and the people who
watched it vs people who liked it leans towards people whom I tend to
agree with. This was not a good movie ...</p>

see it on the weekend. Yes, I am aware that the odds of my being unable
to watch a movie that is over 5 years old is somewhat of a stretch, but
let's pretend I was busy. Every day. For five years. Well okay, six
years.</p>

yourself. I'm not going to list out all majillion of them. Suffice it to
