<h3 id="read">Read Everything</h3>
<p>This has been my life for the last several months. I've read more design
articles then I can honestly count at this point, and I've only just
begun. I've started subscribing to Podcasts so that while I'm at work I
can listen to them. Yes, I can listen to Podcasts <em>and</em> work because I'm
just that good (not actually that good). My Google Reader is growing, my
participation in social networks is slowly expanding, I'm starting to
look beyond what's cool to try and understand the <em>why</em> behind it. This
is progress, and this is what I want to share today.</p>
<p><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></p>
<h3 id="salty">Grains of Salt are Heavy. And Salty.</h3>
<p>In <a href="/2007/11/21/designapalooza-part-one/" title="Designapalooza - Part One">part
one</a> I
talked about reading everything with an open mind and with an
understanding that the authors of the articles you'll read probably know
more than you. After five months I still feel that way, and I'm glad for
it. It proves that I know nothing in comparison to those living and
breathing the field. Does that mean I'm stupid? No, at least I don't
think so. What it means is that there are people out there better than
me, simple as that. It's only a bad thing if you turn your nose up at
them and decide not to learn from them.</p>
<p>A trend I have noticed amongst the Web, which is one I've noticed
starting to bleed into real life, is the idea of collaboration; sharing
information, tips, helpful tidbits, resources, etc. Instead of clinging
to intellectual property and waving a searing iron of distrust at
others, people are actually sharing their ideas. Though many business
people will cringe at the idea, that's the way things are headed and
there's nothing to be done about it. What does that mean for those
deciding to learn? You are now being presented with a plethora of free
information that is actually <em>useful</em>. To ignore this information
(willingly or unwittingly) is an outright sin.</p>
<p>The problem with this flood of information is the fact that anyone and
everyone (myself included) is writing it! All information is suspect at
this point. Unless what you're reading is coming from a known expert,
you can never be sure if the article you are reading is legit. This is
where the grain(s) of salt comes in. I implore you to read as much as
you can about as many facets of design as possible, because information
is power. I also implore you to take everything with a grain of salt. If
you find something suspect or interesting: look it up, and find more on
the subject. You can clear things up pretty quickly with one or two
Google searches.</p>
<p><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></p>
<h3 id="mismatch">Hear Typeface, and Read Audiocasts</h3>
<p>Expand your media. I started off reading RSS feeds from random
locations. Since then I have actively tried to find affiliates to those
blogs to read new aspects on different subjects. I've started listening
to Podcasts to expand my learning even further. Hell I've even watched a
video or three about design topics. What I'm saying is that the Internet
is full of different mediums, and I'd suggest checking out more then the
three design sites you may be subscribed to.</p>
<p>get_leader</p>
<p>When you do find yourself overwhelmed with your intake of information
(everyone suffers from information overload) start to prioritize your
inputs. If you know 5 sites, and a podcast always bring you the most
consistent, well-formed ideas and articles, make the effort to read and
hear and see those first. Don't forget about the others, but when you
only have so many hours in a day, It's beneficial to yourself to keep
your eyes on the prize.</p>
<p>So what happens to those neglected feeds? Read them when you have the
time. Don't let them interfere with your day to day life (some of us
have jobs that consume their free time) and you can't let yourself get
side-tracked with a 40 minute podcast that ends up being rambling.</p>
<p><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></p>
<h3 id="open">Keeping an Open Mind is the Key to [insert something prophetic here]</h3>
<p>I couldn't think of a cool way to end the header, but the first part is
golden. Keep an open mind about what you read. You will, in your
travels, come across people who you disagree with. Maybe you have sound
reason behind it, maybe you just don't like the look of their display
picture. Try and stay objective about it all.</p>
<p>If you disagree with something, figure out what it is you disagree with,
and read up on it. It could be that the article is right on the money
and it's your perception that's incorrect. The article could also be a
total crock, in which case you were right to double-check things. If you
feel strongly enough about the topic, I invite you to open discussion
with the article writer(s) (if possible) and debate on the subject.
Remember not to make personal attacks during these debates, because that
just runs a good conversation/opportunity to learn right into the
ground.</p>
<p>What I'm getting at here is that you shouldn't shoot ideas down for
pretty much any reason. Even the really, really silly-sounding ones
should at least be discussed. Remember that people don't always talk
completely out of their ass. Sometimes, but not always. Discussions and
debates allow for an expansion on the topic(s) at hand and everyone - or
at the very least you - can walk away with even more knowledge then you
would have had by simply reading the original post.</p>
<p><a href="#toc">Back to top</a></p>
<h3 id="stash">My personal Stash</h3>
<p>And I'm ending this article off with a list of every website I subscribe
to, participate in, or otherwise know about. I assume that many of these
will be common knowledge, but I hope that someone out there will be able
to use at least one of these. Without further ado, the list:</p>

<p>I would actually love anyone and everyone willing to contribute to
comment on this post with their favorite Feeds, Blogs, Social sites,
and/or other resources that you use to gain insight into the world of
design.</p>
<p>This is the seventh and final part in an ongoing series of articles that
depicts my process to becoming a graphic designer. I hope that anyone
who followed along with this series can come away with something from
it. I thank you for taking the time to read the ramblings of someone who
happens to love design, despite having the official documentation to
back it up.</p>
<p>Have fun, and keep learning.</p>
