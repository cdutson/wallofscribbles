            <p>Font-replacement is a thing now on the internet. Gone are the days of
Helvetica, Arial, and like, three other fonts. Now designers, coders,
and hacks can add fonts to any web project. Heck, sometimes even for
free!</p>
<p>But of course there are always drawbacks. The number of font-files you
need is staggering, and the CSS you need to set up borders on the
insane. Here's <a href="http://www.fontspring.com/blog/the-new-bulletproof-font-face-syntax" title="fontspring.com - The New Bulletproof @Font-Face Syntax">the best CSS code I've seen for

Then there's the licensing issues: font's ain't free (mostly). If you
want to use a good collection of the fonts out there, you have to pay.

            <p>So I've been doing a lot of javascript development at work recently.
I've basically created a lot of our reusable javascript 'plugins' to
cover the common requirements of the work that we do. In many cases,
this resides mostly (but not entirely) in online annual-report creation.</p>
<p>Anyone that's in the business will know that there are some common
functional elements that you end up having to build with javascript:
accordions, tabs, faders, sliders, lightboxes, filters, etc. Many of
these items can bleed over into non-report sites, such as intranets or
even public-facing sites.</p>

<p>Now some of those are fairly straight forward: an accordion is just a
simple animate of a content section, repeat per title; tabs? Same ...</p></!--more-->

            <p>It's actually been a while since I've been to the theaters. The last
time I was there, I saw TRON. We all know how I <a href="/2010/tron-legacy-it-made-me-has-a-sad" title="Wallofscribbles.com - TRON Legacy. It made me has a sad">felt about

Generally I'll watch movies at home rather than pay the anal-rending

<p>However, there are a bunch of legitimately interesting movies coming out
right now. So much so that I am willing to go to the movie theaters to
watch them (though I'll admit that this decision is assisted heavily by
the 2 for 1 deal I can get every wednesday).</p>

            <p>So while I doubt many people come to my actual website anymore, anyone
who has done so in the last week or so will have noticed a... minor
change to the site. That is to say that I've utterly changed everything.
Basically I was getting bored of my old one, and to be honest I wasn't
happy with any part of the design of the old layout from the get go.</p>
<p>I made the last one basically because I have an impulse to change my
layout roughly once every year (or two). I was suckered into the whole
pop-out style that was going around at the time, and I wanted my piece
of the action. As a side-effect ...</p>

is a strange one for me. I started off by, quite frankly, disliking it.
I went off about how playing through the game in single-player would be
a chore, and so the only time I would actually play it would be at my
friends house. Preferably only after a decent amount of drinking.
Nothing really struck me as truly amazing about it, and whined that the
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BakS1TcIKuk" title="Youtube.com - The original Borderlands trailer">original
version</a>
would have been so much cooler/more epic/a better RPG/whatever the hell

Basically as long as Level 5 keep coming out with these games, they will
keep taking the money I throw at them.</p>

mini-games, new puzzles, and one of the best story-lines in a game I've
played in the last while. As a result, the newest addition to the series
