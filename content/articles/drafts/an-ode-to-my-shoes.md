Shoes.

We all need shoes. Well ok, we don't _need_ shoes, but I think it's safe to say that most of us prefer wearing them while we go about our daily lives (if you prefer not to, well then more power to you). I say this because we've managed to construct a wide array of shoe types, not even accounting for the different sub-styles. We've got dress shoes, skate shoes, safety shoes, cowboy boots, dance shoes, heels, pumps, wedges, sandals, hi-tops, sneakers, running shoes, walking shoes, hiking shoes, wellington boots, thigh-highs, the list doth continue.

What's more, is that not all shoes are created equal. We've all been there: you try some on in the store; they feel good in your 30 second runway-walk to the mirror; you buy them; you spray them; you put them on the next day for a walk, and you end up with a thousand blisters. That's happened to the best of us.

Of course, the opposite is also true. Sometimes you find a shoe that feels like it was sculpted for your feet alone. Walking in them is as close to perfection as it can be without them _actually_ being moulded to the contours of your stompers.

This is an ode to my shoes: They started as the former, and ended life as the latter.

## Before we start

Know what's funny? I actually had this long, meandering story about these shoes. It was an exercise in writing that I set forth for myself. It covered their origins, and then I was going to go into our spotty relationship before lamenting that they were the comfiest shoes I've had in a long time.

I'm sure if you dig through the git history of this file you can read all that, but I couldn't even bring myself to finish it. It's not that it was bad or anything. I know it wasn't pulitzer-winning stuff, but it wasn't, _like,_ terrible.

It was however long-winded and needlessly self-indulgent. So I opted for a total rewrite, and here we are

## My shoes

I bought my shoes whilst living in England from a store named [Schuh](http://tribulant.net/shoppingcart/product/mens-adidas-culver-mid-trainers/). They were resplendent when I bought them; simply stunning. I bought them while I was still sporting some other Nike hightops that I'm not going to spend the same amount of time looking up.

Seriously I spent hours tracking these shoes down on the internet. Seriously, like 7 hours. Thankfully a friend of mine, a man much more shoe-headed than myself, tracked them down in about 20 minutes. He's fabulous. Thanks Mark.

Anywho, I bought them for a reasonable price, and then they sat in my home for months before I actually tried em on for a longer stint.

Turns out they weren't actually all that comfortable. In fact, they really kind of sucked to wear for any long period of time. I tried me out a couple times, and all I got for that was blisters. So I threw 'em in the closet and the followed me from home to home until I got back to Canada, years later.

## Shoes in Canada

Since coming back to Canada, I've lost a chunk of disposable income, because it turns out the UK economy and the Canadian economy are vastly different. As a result I haven't been able to do much shoe shopping.

Well okay, the shoes released for guys in the recent years have been boring, for the most part. The only way to get awesome-looking shoes is through the internet, and I have such troubles buying shoes as it is.

Oh, and I had a [daughter](). That totally eats away at excess finances.

So I did what anyone in my position would do: I wore every other pair of shoes until they were ready to be tossed. I was eventually left with no other option than to wear these hurting bastards, and wore them I did.

## The beginning of the end

The first day of wearing those shoes was one that found myself walking roughly 4 kilometres in the rain. The result of that walk was that my shoes enacted a blood sacrifice from my big toe.

I mean that literally my toe was so torn up that I've actually got a scar there now. However, since my shoes slaked their thirst for blood, they suddenly became the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. Seriously, I have never had shoes that have felt anything near this comfortable in my life. I probably never will again.

As a result, I wore these shoes until they were basically unrecognizable. They reached that sort of worn in that street urchins would wear in a play.

## Their sendoff

I bought some new shoes (no where near as comfortable) after my co-workers mocked my shoes. These new ones are fine, but nowhere near as comfortable. So I did what anyone would probably not do: I took a bunch of photos of them to write a blog post.

So anyways, here's some more photos of my hobo-level shoes for what it's worth.
