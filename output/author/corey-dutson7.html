            <p>Recently, I found an all-classical FM station broadcasting out of
Toronto that I can actually listen to in Brantford, Cambridge, and
Kitchener-Waterloo. This may not sound like anything impressive - who
even listens to FM radio anymore - but if you have ever tried to listen
to Toronto-based radio in those areas, you would know what I'm talking
about. There is something about this strip of land that just destroys
radio signals.</p>
<p>Regardless, since I've found this station, I have yet to change it back
to the others that I listen to. <a href="http://www.classical963fm.com/" title="Classical 96.3FM">Classical

amazing job of not only featuring brilliant classical music, past and
present, but also features spots like "Sunday night at the Opera", "The ...</p>

I know, but it hurt all the same. High school wasn't any better. I never

            <p>So where to begin? I've started school, though it's only frosh week so
that doesn't count. I'm liking <a href="http://www.mohawkcollege.ca/homepage.html" title="Mohawk Collge">Mohawk

than <a href="http://www.conestogac.on.ca/" title="Conestoga College">Conestoga</a> in
terms of the faculty. Not that
<a href="http://www.conestogac.on.ca/" title="Conestoga College">Conestoga</a>'s was bad,
but the staff at
<a href="http://www.mohawkcollege.ca/homepage.html" title="Mohawk Collge">Mohawk</a>
really seem to give a damn. These teachers actually seem to want to help
me out, especially since I've been working on switching from one stream
to another. The campus (Brantford - Elgin) feels like a high school for
grown ups - I said the same about
<a href="http://www.conestogac.on.ca/" title="Conestoga College">Conestoga</a> - and I've
come to the decision that colleges must look like bigger high schools.
Only Universities can have shiny arty architecture, and nice stuff.</p>

he held any magical prowess, or that he was an imposing beast of a man.
No, he is nothing more then a pick-pocket, good with a knife, but
nothing spectacular. It was more in the way he carried himself. The way
that despite the fact that, even now, as he walks towards the court
where all of us are painfully aware that he will be sentenced to death,
he walks with his head held high. Considering the charges lay against
him, it will probably be a beheading in the main square outside the

<p>How can I describe this album? I guess it's Indie, but not really. It
really has a bluegrass/pop/alternative blend that really defies clear
classification. Brian O'Neal (way to hard to find his real name, Jesus),
who goes by <a href="http://www.roarkmusic.com/" title="Roark">Roark</a>, does a
fantastic job of delivering heart-felt song after heart-felt song. Each
track sounds like he means every word, which is a rare treat in this day
and age. Though he is technically a solo artist, Brian does have someone
helping him in the studio ...</p>

is so chalked full of tribute lines that it's a little impressive that
they got some of them in. I admit that one or two of them feel a little
