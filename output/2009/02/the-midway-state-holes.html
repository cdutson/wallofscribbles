        <p>Oh how I wish this review was going to go well. A lot of people like
<a href="http://www.themidwaystate.com/" title="The Midway State">The Midway State</a>.
Hell, I'm sure a lot of people really love this album. I want to like
it, but I keep getting hung up on things. I know two things will happen
with this review. First, anyone who is a massive fan of The Midway State
is going to nail me to the wall and then stone me to death. Second, I'll
have to actually listen to the whole album through two more times to
actually find songs that I like.</p>
<p>Wait, those could be out of order. It doesn't matter, they'll both
happen one way or the other.<!--more--></p>

<p>I was first told to listen to The Midway State by a fellow classmate.
She and I share similar tastes in music, and so when she offered me her
iPod to listen to The Midway State in class, I eagerly agreed. I tried
to listen to the album, but simply too much was going on during the
class, and I couldn't give the album the attention that it deserved.</p>
<p>Months later, I started hearing "Never Again" on the radio, which is a
single from The Midway States newest album
"<a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Holes-Midway-State/dp/B001BKKBGQ/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music&amp;qid=1234924777&amp;sr=8-1" title="Amazon.ca: The Midway State - Holes">Holes</a>."
I liked the pop-y bounce beat, and I have a weakness for guys that sing
in a higher range (I think

At the same time, Theresa had a request that I get my hands on the album
for her, because she's too busy with school at the moment. "Two birds
with one stone!" I thought to myself.</p>
<p>Yeah so I guess I missed one of the birds with this one.</p>
<p>See once I started listening to the album, I realized that I wasn't
really being moved by the album at all. I'll admit that I was working
through 6 hours of Photoshop homework at the time, but I still gave much
of my attention to the music. Like I said at the beginning, I wanted to
like this album but it just wasn't doing it for me.</p>
<p>I searched for a term I could use to describe this album; a silly
notion, you would think, trying to summarize an entire musical album
with just one word or phrase.</p>
<p>Turns out I managed to do that for Holes; that word is "Listless."</p>
<p>get_leader</p>
<p>Other than the first track, none of the band members really seem to want
to be there. The singing seems half-hearted, and the music itself is
almost depressing. This is despite the happy pop bounce that exists
within a fair portion of the tracks. Now there are some more mellow
tracks with goals that seem to be primarily in making you feel like your
dog just died. In these cases, the depressed, almost bored sounding
singing almost fits the bill. Too bad that this effect was probably
achieved unintentionally.</p>
<p>What makes it all the more sad is that If i tried to make a comparison
to other bands, I could. The problem is that I even though I can compare
them (Killers meets The Editors, if you're wondering), the bands I am
comparing them too are just so much better than this one. It sounds like
they want to be awesome, but they just don't have the heart. The end
result of the music just falls flat to me, which is a shame given the
obvious potential.</p>
<p>To try and be positive, I can see where the appeal in this album would
be. It's fairly mellow, with much piano use and toned-down melodies
throughout. The singing itself is much the same, giving the whole album
a very subdued feel throughout it. Even the stings of electrical guitar
that happen throughout don't really take away from that. The music does
seem carefully thought out in both mood and arrangement. Credit where
it's due, I'm sure this is what they were going for and in that respect
they nailed it.</p>
<p>Overall I'm really sad I couldn't like this album more, because usually
I can find the good in most music. Sadly there's nothing in Holes that
makes me want to keep it on my hard drive.</p>
