The whole album is very mellow, and I could almost class it as an
'easy-listening' but it doesn't quite fit. The songs all feature a
slightly slower beat, and there is emphases on strong musical usage. The
singing is put almost as a second thought, much like the way that The
Strokes perform their music. The music comes before the singing, but
they don't conflict. There is heavy usage of the piano, which stands out
as the major player within most of the tracks. The lyrics are
well-written and executed, and anyone can find meaning in them. The
singing reminds me a lot of Coldplay or Snow Patrol, as they are a
little grainy, and full of emotion.

The whole album has a near-sad feel to it, mainly due to contributions
from certain tracks (Bad Dream and I Am Who I Am come to mind). As a
result I don't suggest listening to "Beta Male Fairytales" if you're in
a low, unless you feel like throwing yourself further into despair. It's
not even the lyrics that really do it, but the mood of the songs

One problem I have with the album (which is a problem with many albums
of a similar nature) is that I can only listen to it once through before
I start to get sick of it. This is not a CD that you can leave on repeat
in the background, as it will start to feel very repetitive. Every track
does start to feel like every other on the CD as you continue to listen
to it. It's definitely an album where favorites will be picked, and the
other tracks skipped for the rest if their existence.

Overall, a very calm, almost sad album with heavy piano use and
wonderful lyrics. It's worth a listen to, even if you only come away
with three songs that you like. In the end you'll love those tracks
dearly.

7/10
