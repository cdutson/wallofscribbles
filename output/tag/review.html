<p>Flowers for Algernon is a heart-aching story about a Charlie, a
mentally-handicapped 32 year-old man who wants to be smart. He can read
and write, and works hard to learn so that he can become smart so people
will like him. He works are Donners bakery where Mr. Donner gives him 11
dollars a week plus all the food he wants. When approached with the
opportunity of a lifetime - the chance to be made smart intelligent - he
feels that his ship has come in. He takes the opportunity and is given a
second chance at life, becoming smarter by the day.</p>

tracks and a slightly softer feel. MCS know what their sound is and they

is very much like the original, but with a few added tricks. Released in
North America January of 2007, Current fans salivated over the new game.
Featuring slightly improved graphics, - maybe I'm nuts but I don't
recall moving mouths in the first game - slightly better music, an
expanded cast, and a new feature to aggravate the player, Justice For
All provides hours of entertaining Lawyer-y fun.</p>
<p>The downside to the game right off the bat is that there are only four
cases, unlike the original version which had five. Other than that, this
game features many subtle improvements that should not be overlooked.

2005 (if you live in North America as I do) this game became an instant
hit and flew off the shelves. Now granted I waited two years before

bought a DS. I have to make sure to buy my friend Dane a decorative cake

went on during the time. All the characters are pulled into differing
sub-cultures and left to their own devices, and are let to play out
their lives with what they've gotten themselves into. It demonstrates
what people are capable of when they feel the need to work for
something. It displays people in their best and worst moments without
much in the ways of compromise, and shows that people aren't perfect nor
do situations always work out glowing. It does glaze over one or two
