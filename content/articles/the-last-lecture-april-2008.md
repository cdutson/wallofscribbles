I am not the first person to talk about this book, and I know damned
well that I won't be the last. That aside, I have little choice but to
talk about The Last Lecture. I meant to talk about the original online
version when I first saw it the day Randy Pausch died. I know it's
somewhat of a morbid coincidence, but it's true and I can't tell you how
heart-broken I was when I found out this tidbit of information.

[When I saw the actual
lecture](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo "Randy Pausch: The Last Lecture"),
I was at work. Though I told myself I would let it play in the
background as I worked, that idea was quickly thrown out and I watched
the 76 minute video without pause. Actually there was one pause when I
went to the washroom. You get the idea.

When I [found out he had a
book](http://www.amazon.ca/Last-Lecture-Randy-Pausch/dp/1401323251/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1225953400&sr=8-1 "Randy Pausch: The Last Lecture (Book)"),
the only reason I didn't buy it was because my girlfriend wanted it. So
I got it for her and borrowed it when she was finished.

Randy Pausch was diagnosed with Pancreatic Cancer. Anyone who knows
anything about this cancer (which is surprisingly little, as it turns
out) knows that being diagnosed with this type of cancer is basically
being handed a death warrant. Randy had three children - 6, 4, and 2 if
I recall correctly - and the thing that ripped him apart the most was
that he wouldn't be able to be there as they grew up. His youngest
children would probably have no memory of him whatsoever.

As luck would have it, the university he worked at - Carnegie Mellon
University - had a series of lectures called "The Last Lecture" and
asked him to do one. He realized that this would be a way to immortalize
himself a bit for his children. He delivered the lecture, explaining how
to achieve one's childhood dreams, how to help others achieve theirs,
and how to live one's life.

The Last Lecture, the book that is, is not a verbatim transcript of the
lecture, though that would have been rather good in and of itself. No,
the book has everything the delivered lecture had, but it also had
stories that took place before and after said lecture. The book reveals
even more about what an extraordinary person Randy actually was. I know
it sounds corny, but as it turns out he really was a fantastic
individual.

I'm not trying to gush over the late Randy Pausch, far from it in fact.
What I'm trying to say is that everything he says in his book is a
direct extension of him; his past, his present, and the future he never
has. His words of wisdom will most likely be quoted for years to come by
parents to their children, and they may not even remember where they got
it from.

My only complaint with the book is that it is too short. The reason I
say this is because he shouldn't of had to write a book, but because he
was put into this position by things beyond his control, he did what he
could. If and when his children read The Last Lecture, I hope that they
can take away from it as much as the rest of the world has. The book is
a perfect blend of sorrow and schadenfreude. You're damned happy you're
not him, but your devastated that this man is dead. I can honestly say
that reading through this book brought me to tears more than once. It
moved me very, very deeply.

It's just as fantastic as the lecture, but delivers even more personal
stories and feelings to the reader. It's as tragic as it is magnificent,
and I mean it when I say that everyone should read this book.

Everyone.

11/10 - Just cause I friggin' can.
