            <p>On the weekend I went out with Theresa and four others (sister, roomie,
and the boyfriends) to one of the only things to do in North Bay. You
really only get four options: Drink, have sex, go to the mall, or go to
the movies. Well you can mix and match those, but that's basically it.
Regardless, we went to the movies.</p>
<p>This is where I saw Good Luck Chuck.</p>
<p>Now I've heard people saying that either it was good, or it sucked
dirty, smelly anus. The bell curve for this movie and the people who
watched it vs people who liked it leans towards people whom I tend to
agree with. This was not a good movie ...</p>

            <p>Yeah, I'm aware the movie came out some time ago, but I only just got to
see it on the weekend. Yes, I am aware that the odds of my being unable
to watch a movie that is over 5 years old is somewhat of a stretch, but
let's pretend I was busy. Every day. For five years. Well okay, six
years.</p>
<p>Shutup.</p>
<p>Anyways, it stars a fuck-load of actors whom you can look up a list of
yourself. I'm not going to list out all majillion of them. Suffice it to
say they were actually on their A-game for this one.</p>

noticed that seem to have fallen off the face of the planet. This is, of
course, an ignorant assumption because of gravity. It is impossible to
fall off the planet, let alone its face.</p>
<p>I have however been busy with life, being lazy with updating this, and
other lame excuses that I cannot fathom at the moment.</p>
<p>I'm not going to bother with all that because quite honestly I was just
lazy and had no drive to update this site. No real reason, but I'm back

            <p>The first thing to note is that Mr. Brooks varies his writing style to
give each story a life of its own. No two narrators sounded alike, which
I have to admit was an impressive thing to behold. The second, and
easily the more important of the two, things to note is that the stories
for the most part managed to move me.</p>
<p>Considering the entire book is a work of fiction, Brooks managed rather
well to make it feel very real. What's more is that he managed to make
it feel very <em>human</em>. few authors can truly say the same.</p>
<p>An impressive read over all,</p>

            <p>I can honestly say that by reading this book, I actually do feel
somewhat more comfortable about my chances should the dead rise again.
Suffice it to say, Max Brooks takes the idea rather seriously. So
seriously that he has covered everything in this book. Weapons, Survival
gear, locational ratings, terrain types, preventive plans, cleanup
plans, and even a worst case scenario. In all honesty it was in fact, a
honest to God guide on surviving the zombie hordes that come, shambling
and disheveled, to your door.</p>
<p>As a result, the first half of the book (the guide half, which is closer
to three quarters, really) was eventually a bit of a dry read. I'm not
saying this is ...</p>

<p>I couldn't have said it any better, but before I get into this lemme put
things into context here. <em>I love Spider-man</em>. Truly I do. The idea that
a man is doing the right thing even though his world falls apart around
him is truly noble and something I wish to aspire two when push comes to

fantastic writing and British humour so dry, you could use it as a

review thing, so I'm going to try to do this as best I can.<br />
This movie is for all intents and purposes, fantastic. It manages to
take skits from every block-busting action movie (Bad Boys 2, Point
Break, Aliens, etc etc) while still retaining its own identity, brought
about by brilliant writing.</p>
<p>The story, briefly , is that Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is a

higher-ups whisk him off ...</p>
