What does it mean to understand design? Good question. I wish I had a
concrete answer, but I don't and so you'll have to take what I say here
with a grain of salt. I would suggest checking
[some](http://www.graphicdesignblog.co.uk/ "Graphic design blog")
[other](http://blogs.graphicdesignforum.com/ "Graphic Design Forum Blogs")
[blogs](http://www.hellyeahdude.com/ "Hell Yeah Dude!") and seeing what
[they](http://www.younggogetter.com/ "Young Go Getter")
[have](http://www.subtraction.com/ "Subtraction")
[to](http://ilovetypography.com/ "I Love Typography")
[say](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/ "Smashing Magazine"). From what I
gather (and I have been working hard to gather a lot) understanding
design means understanding not only techniques, but how using those
techniques influence the end-user. Understanding design means knowing
that by changing the lighting of an image, you will change its mood,
even if only by toning the light down 2 Watts. Understanding design is
knowing that you have to convey a message/experience/feeling/essence by
more then something that looks cool. Understanding design is as much
about understanding the technique as it is about understanding the
effect.

Understanding design is about understanding people.

### All the Hard Stuff Out of the Way First {#swag}

Alright, so being the idiot that I was when I started this series (the
same idiot that I am now, as it turns out) I asked a whole wack of
questions to make you, the reader, think. I did not think at the time
that I would actually have to come up with answers to them. Thankfully,
I found a loophole: I don't have to. That's right, I'm not going to
answer anything. The reason for this is that I'd probably be wrong, or
explain something incorrectly. What I *can* do is list those same
questions out, give what I think is a good explanation, and link a bunch
of sources so that you can draw your own conclusions!

I'm amazingly <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">lazy</span>
brilliant. To add to my brilliance, I am going to splice this post into
two separate posts. The reason for this is that I tend to write a fair
amount, and I don't think having a one-page novel will be useful to
anyone

#### "Do they understand composition?" {#composition}

This one is a little hard to field, because composition can be applied
to a whole range of subjects. You can define how a news article is
composed, how a photo was composed, or the composition of a magazine
spread. The general idea is this: Composition is how you set up
something to affect the end-user. In a way composition is an
all-encompassing idea of what graphic design is. I'm going to get really
lazy here, and site Websters here:

I am, in this instance referring to 1,2, 4, and 5. There are many, many
sources based solely on the understanding of composition, most of which
I will not list here. [Google](http://www.google.com "Google") will be
your friend when it comes to this one, though I will link the [Wikipedia
article on
Composition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_(visual_arts) "Wikipedia")
to give you a heads up. Seriously, This is like asking "do you
understand philosophy?" because in the design sense, it amounts to the
same thing and I feel stupid for asking this one.

#### "How about contrast?" {#contrast}

This one I can do. Contrast is pretty straight-forward to explain, but
harder to achieve without making your design look like hell. What makes
more contrast? White text in a black box or black text in a white box?
technically they are the same, but what happens when you add the rest of
the page into the mix? a white background-based page will make the black
box with white text stand out way more. The inverse would also be true
(black bg page). Contrast, for all intents and purposes is how much
something stands out against everything around it.

Another example is using large, bold text to highlight something. An
example I will use is headers in html. H1 is somewhat large, and helps
distinguish text from everything around it. This is a contrast through
size and weight. It stands out from everything around it and draws the
users eyes to it. From what I gather, this is the main (but not the
only) purpose of contrast: to draw attention to something/make something
stand out (which is the same as drawing attention to it!0

Contrast can be achieved a couple of ways: Colour, White-space (I go
into this later), Size, and probably others but I am unwilling to list
them.

Resources to look at:

-   [This](http://www.gomediazine.com/design-tip/rule-three-contrast-contrast-contrast/ "The Go MediaZine: Contrast")
    is a lovely article written by The Go MediaZine on contrast.

#### "Weight?"

Another one of those 'should have specified' sort of items. Since I
didn't I shall cover two items: font weight, and paper weight.

Paper weight. What's the point? First off, there is way more science
involved in paper weight than I had originally thought. I refuse to
explain said science, but I will be extra helpful and link
[some](http://www.paper-paper.com/weight.html "Paper-paper")
[helpful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_size "Wikipedia")
[articles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_density "Wikipedia") that
you can peruse at you leisure to better understand how paper
density(weight) is defined.

What I will explain, though sadly I am unable to site any of this and so
I am going from what I've learned over time, is the effect paper weight
has on people. From what I've seen at work when you want something on
paper noticed, use a different paper. People are very physical
creatures, whether we deny it or not. Just like your old school
councilors who used to advocate printing your resumé on a different
colour of paper, the same can be said for the type of paper that you
print it on. A heavier stock will gain you notice right from the get go,
and the originality therein will allow your work to be read with at
least some amount of interest. Using a heavier stock can also work When
you want to give something a cover without giving it a cover, if you get
my drift. I'm not saying that you should now print everything of worth
off on a heavier stock (which can get tricky) but it's a good way to
stand out.

Font weight can be (and is) used in both traditional and digital print.
It walks hand-in-hand with contrast, leading the user, and focal points
(actually they all work together, but whatever). Font weight has much to
do with how people interpret text. When something is **bold** or
*emphasized* you will instantly pay more attention, if only because it's
different from everything around it.

#### "Spacing?"

Spacing is a whole sub-culture that I could probably write a whole
article on by itself. I'm not going to do that though, because I am lazy
and pressed for time. Instead I'm going to outsource a good portion of
this to PSDTuts.com and their new article: '[9 Essential Principles for
Good Web
Design](http://psdtuts.com/designing-tutorials/9-essential-principles-for-good-web-design/ "PSDTuts.com")'.

The points made here basically summarize on the web front how spacing
can effect your layout. The third point (White Space) can apply to both
Print and Digital designers. Using spacing properly can help create
contrast via negative-space and helping to emphasize areas. Utilizing
spacing properly will also allow for the user (or viewer) to read text
more clearly and will help to direct them where you want.[](#toc)

#### "Kerning?"

Ahh kerning. a simple demonstration of a lack of kerning can be seen...
basically everywhere on the internet. Any time you see flat text on the
internet - and in this case flat text means text NOT in an image -
chances are you have seen an example of bad - or in this case, lack - of
kerning. Kerning is, in a somewhat simplified sense, the action of
adjusting the spacing between type characters. [Here is a good visual
example](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/k/kerning.htm "What is kerning?"),
along with a definition! See how efficient I am?

Something you have to realize is that with flat text (flat text in this
instance means any text that is not in an image, or is otherwise
manipulatable via HTML) cannot really have much in the ways of kerning.
I'm not saying you can't do it, as CSS has properties you can manipulate
(see: font-width); but unless you are going to manually edit every
paragraph of text, then you're stuck with what the font does on its own.

If you are doing print or image text - text that is part of a digital
image, or otherwise used on the Internet) then you have to make this
common practice. I can't tell you how annoying it is to suddenly be
taught about kerning, and then realizing how many creations suffer from
a complete lack. If I ever get around to making my new layout, then the
logo would be a great example. As for now though, take a look at the
title of this page.

"WallOfScribbles"

note how far away the "a" is from the "W" Since this is flat text, I'm
kinda boned. If it was an image though, there should be no excuse as to
why the W should be so orphaned.

[Photoshop](http://www.lyzrdstomp.com/tutorial_kerning/ "Photoshop Kerning")
and
[Fireworks](http://www.communitymx.com/content/article.cfm?page=2&cid=63B17 "Fireworks and Illustrator Kerning")
both offer workarounds to bad kerning, so pay attention to it!

### More to Come {#more}

I'll post more answers to my own questions in the next installment
people. Sorry but there is no way I am writing a one-page novella. No
one wants that, and I don't want to have to sit here writing that.

[](#toc)This is the fifth part in an ongoing series of articles that
depicts my process to becoming a graphic designer. Coming up next: Part
two (six) where I explain the other half of my many, many design
questions.
