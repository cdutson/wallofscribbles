fun.</p>
<p>Risk is hard; it is an unforgiving mistress.</p>
<p>Risk should only be played with people you already hate, or with people
whom you will learn to forgive, and they you. Risk is the destroyer of
people, friendships, and nations alike. Risk sorts out the winners from
the losers; the strong from the weak.</p>
<p>I love Risk, but there's a problem: Risk takes a long time, and usually
devolves into

and utter recklessness. As this is usually the end result, why not
expedite the whole thing? And why not add alcohol into the mix?</p>
<!--more-->

<p>I've come up with what I like to feel should be a 30ish minute variant
of
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MRZGC4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B004MRZGC4&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=walofscr-20" title="&gt;Risk%20Game&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img%20src=&quot;http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=walofscr-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B004MRZGC4 &quot;Amazon.com - Risk Board game">Risk</a> that
a group of friends (or foes) can use to get their evening started, and
also by way of result get devastatingly drunk. Why did I create this?
Because as much fun as normal Risk is, attention spans are finite, and
who doesn't like drinking with their friends? Well, except people who
don't like to drink... I guess they wouldn't, but then why are you
reading this if you're one of <em>those people?</em></p>
<p>Without further rambling, I present to you: High Stakes Risk.</p>
<h2>High Stakes Risk</h2>
<p>Still here eh? Good.</p>
<h3>What you need</h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Classic Risk, though technically
    any variation would work.</span></li>
<li>Shot glasses.</li>
<li>Your choice of shooter. You can have everyone to drink the same, or
    have different alcohols for what I've dubbed "The Chalice of
    Failure," which is used in <a href="#dragonsAhead" title="Even Hire Stakes Risk">Even Higher Stakes
    Risk</a> which is detailed at
    the end of this post.</li>
<li>A timer.</li>
<li>Probably some bread or something because things are gonna get real
    bad real fast.</li>
<li>Some friends. The mechanics change slightly depending on the number
    of friends.</li>
<li>A liver.</li>
<li>Your wits.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Preparation</h3>
<p>To play High Stakes Risk, you are going to be playing the game in
classic domination mode, no mission cards, no alternate success
strategies; you are taking over the world, pure and simple. Dice rules
are the same as Classic Risk, as well at the typical sections of the
player's round (playing armies, cards, attacking, moving).</p>
<p>To get started:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deal out all of the countries to all the players, no neutral or free
    countries should be on the board. These should be dealt out through
    random lottery (such as the shuffling and dealing of country cards
    if your version has them).</li>
<li>Roll to see who starts.</li>
<li>Each player takes their turn laying out their armies.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rules for standard play</h3>
<p>Each round is comprised of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Each player is given a <strong>finite
    amount of time</strong> to play their round. At 5 players, I recommend
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>1 minute per
    round</em></span>. If you have less players, you can add 10 seconds for
    each person lacking, so a 2 player game allows for 1 minute 30
    seconds per round. When a players time is up, they must stop what
    they're doing, regardless of the action.</span></li>
<li>Each round the player adds their units wherever they see fit, <span
    style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>there are no limitations on
    country-specific units and their placement</em></span>.</li>
<li>Each round the player <strong>must</strong> attempt to take at least one country.
    No round is allowed to pass without attacking.<br />
<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If the player takes an
    enemy country</span>:</em> that countries owner will have to take a shot
    at the end of the round. If the player takes multiple countries from
    multiple opponents, they will all have to drink at the end of
    the round. Only one shot per player, regardless of the number of
    countries seized (<em>unless you enjoy alcohol poisoning.</em>)<br />
<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If the player fails to
    take a country or does not attack</span>:</em> That player must take a
    shot, while the other players openly mock them.</li>
<li>When the timer is up, the user must stop what they are doing,
    <strong>regardless of action</strong>. This means if they are placing armies,
    they will have to wait until their next round to finish; if they
    were in the middle of attacking, they must stop; If they were moving
    armies, they must stop.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Success and loss criteria</h3>
<p><strong><em>A player is considered defeated when: </em></strong>they have no more armies and
no more countries. At that point, they must take 1 more shot, and then
spend the rest of the game regretting their bad decisions.</p>
<p><strong><em>A player is also considered defeated if they forfeit.</em></strong> If a player
forfeits, the game is paused and the lands and armies are transferred to
the remaining players by way of lottery. You can use: rock, paper,
scissors; evens and odds; lucky dice; or whatever method of blind luck
you agree upon. Once all of the countries and armies are distributed,
the game instantly resumes on the next players round.</p>
<p><strong><em>The game is over when:</em></strong> one player controls the entire board, or;
all of the other players have forfeited, or; the time limit for the game
is reached (if one was set at the start of the game).</p>
<p><strong><em>If you are playing with a time-limit to the game, and it runs out:</em></strong>
the winner of the game is the player who has the most countries. If one
or more players have an equal number of countries and are both placed in
first, then a count of armies determines the winner. If those players
also have equal unit counts, than the number of completed zones will
dictate the winner. If they have equal completed zones, then a blind
luck method (such as those dictated in a player forfeit) may be used to
determine the winner.</p>
<h2 id="dragonsAhead">Alterations for Even Higher Stakes Risk</h2>
<p>Even Higher Stakes Risk requires the addition of "The Chalice of
Failure": a large cup, jug, measuring cup, vase, etc. You may decorate
it if you wish.</p>
<p>The Chalice of Failure contains the Losers Brew: a drink made from the
shots of other's winnings. Consult the rule alterations below for
further explanation.</p>
<h3>At the start of the game</h3>
<p>After countries are divided up, but before the game commences, each
player will pour on shot of their chosen drink into The Chalice of
Failure, effectively creating the beginnings of the Loser's Brew. Once
this is done, the game begins.</p>
<h3>Rules for play</h3>
<p>The rules of play operate exactly like High stakes risk, except for the
following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;"><span
    style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>If a player succeeds in taking
    a country</em></span>, they add a shot to The Chalice of Failure. All
    affected opponents still take their shot for countries lost.</span></li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>If a player tries to play
    past their allotted time</em></span>, they may be punished, at the
    discretion of the group. This can be an additional drink, a lost of
    time next round, loss of additional armies next round, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3>When the game is over</h3>
<p>When the game is over, a single shot is drawn from The Chalice of
Failure. This is given to the winner of the game. The rest of the
contents from The Chalice of Failure is divided evenly amongst the
players who have lost. They winner will cheers the losers with their
shot, and drink it. This is to honour the other players valiant efforts.
The losers must then drink their share of the Losers Brew.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

stories of your own! I'd love to see how others have played this out.</p>
