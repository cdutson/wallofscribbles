### Table of contents: {#toc}

1.  [Read Everything](#read)
2.  [Grains of Salt are Heavy. And Salty.](#salty)
3.  [Hear Typeface, and Read Audiocasts](#mismatch)
4.  [Keeping an Open Mind is the Key to  {#open}

I couldn't think of a cool way to end the header, but the first part is
golden. Keep an open mind about what you read. You will, in your
travels, come across people who you disagree with. Maybe you have sound
reason behind it, maybe you just don't like the look of their display
picture. Try and stay objective about it all.

If you disagree with something, figure out what it is you disagree with,
and read up on it. It could be that the article is right on the money
and it's your perception that's incorrect. The article could also be a
total crock, in which case you were right to double-check things. If you
feel strongly enough about the topic, I invite you to open discussion
with the article writer(s) (if possible) and debate on the subject.
Remember not to make personal attacks during these debates, because that
just runs a good conversation/opportunity to learn right into the
ground.

What I'm getting at here is that you shouldn't shoot ideas down for
pretty much any reason. Even the really, really silly-sounding ones
should at least be discussed. Remember that people don't always talk
completely out of their ass. Sometimes, but not always. Discussions and
debates allow for an expansion on the topic(s) at hand and everyone - or
at the very least you - can walk away with even more knowledge then you
would have had by simply reading the original post.

### My personal Stash {#stash}

And I'm ending this article off with a list of every website I subscribe
to, participate in, or otherwise know about. I assume that many of these
will be common knowledge, but I hope that someone out there will be able
to use at least one of these. Without further ado, the list:

Note: For the record these are not in order of preference.

I would actually love anyone and everyone willing to contribute to
comment on this post with their favorite Feeds, Blogs, Social sites,
and/or other resources that you use to gain insight into the world of
design.

This is the seventh and final part in an ongoing series of articles that
depicts my process to becoming a graphic designer. I hope that anyone
who followed along with this series can come away with something from
it. I thank you for taking the time to read the ramblings of someone who
happens to love design, despite having the official documentation to
back it up.

Have fun, and keep learning.
