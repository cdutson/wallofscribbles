<h3 id="lead">"What about leading the viewers vision?"</h3>
<p>Leading the users vision can really be taken a couple ways, and I figure
I may as well explain both. The first is literally leading the persons
vision to where you want it to go. This basically means drawing
attention to the focus of the picture. This can be done in a multitude
of ways including leading lines, colours, character actions, the
landscape, etc. There are literally endless combinations to lead the
users vision around a picture and I found some lovely links to explain
it better than me. That's how I roll people.</p>

    I'm aware that this is for photography but the principles are still
    the same.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second way I wanted to explain it is sort of on an unconventional
level. That is to say that I'm using this as a thinly veiled excuse to
talk about flow. This has more to do with online designers, though I can
attest that there are many, many articles on flow for print.</p>
<p>The idea of flow is pretty simple. Basically: "Does it flow?" When you
are reading a news article, does it flow constantly? or are there giant,
invasive ads every other paragraph? If it does, it probably doesn't have
good flow, or any at all. The idea is for the user to be able to go from
start to finish with as little pain as possible. When you dump a large
ad, image, or something otherwise unrelated in the way, you interrupt
the user. Another example is web forms. When a user is filing out the
form, is it easy to read, and do the fields and sections generally lead
from one to the other? <a href="http://www.digital-web.com/articles/redesigning_ebay_registration/" title="Digital Web Magazine">This is a fantastic
article</a>
explaining exactly what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>Basically, the idea is that if something flows well the user will have a
more pleasing experience. Flow can also be described how well a process
works, such as registering as a user, submitting a story, or buying an
item. If something has good flow, then the general word attached to the
whole ordeal is "easy" or "simple" regardless of how easy or simple it
actually is.</p>

<h3 id="colour">"Oh, and how about how colours affect moods,"</h3>
<p>Colours effect moods. This is not up for debate, this is actual fact.
Humans are psychologically affected by colours when presented with them.
Some people have an active reaction to them, such as having favorites
and detesting others. Everyone though, is affected by them whether they
realize it or not. Goths wear all black for a reason people! I'm not
sure what that is, having never been one... but they do!</p>
<p>The point I'm getting to here is that behind all of your colour choices
are the effects of your influences. Why do you think that blue is such a
common company colour? It's a generally safe colour to use, as it
doesn't really bring about offense to people. If you know how to use
colour properly and not for just what fits at the time, you will find
that you will be able to actively give your images more power. Remember
that colours have different meanings in different cultures, so it's a
good idea to keep that in mind when designing.</p>

<h3 id="focal">"Do you understand focal points,"</h3>
<p>A focal point is related in many ways to leading the users vision
(scroll up). The focal point or points of something are literally that:
points for the user to focus on. I know that sounds a bit simple, but
believe me when I say that they are important. Having a strong focal
point is like having a solid story for a book. It doesn't matter nearly
as much as to what's going on in the book so long as the story moves
forward clearly. When you lack focal points, you lack focus.</p>
<p>Try and picture it this way: imagine painting a wall black and then
painting a white square in the middle of it. Now ask people to look at
it. They will focus on the white box, whether they mean to or not. Now
granted, it's a white box and will only hold attention for so long, but
it will hold it for as long as a white box can do so. This is your focal
point, which you generated using a simple use contrast.</p>
<p>Now picture this: imagine painting that same wall, but this time you
just went nuts and splattered every colour you could find on it with out
any rhyme or reason, effectively creating a wall of colourful static.
Now ask people to look at it. They'll probably take one glance, and then
ask you what they should be looking for.</p>
<p>This is what focal points are all about. Focal points give your viewers
something to work from; a sort of base of operations in which they can
take the picture in from. If your imagery fails to have focal points,
the user will be wandering around the vision aimlessly and then walk
away.</p>
<p>The same can be said for any of design, whether its traditional, print,
or even digital media. Without focal points your user will become
dis-interested and lose interest. This is generally bad, unless it's all
part of some secret plan to get the user to look away and focus on
another piece completely. I guess that would be focal points on a grand
scale!</p>

<h3 id="gold">"or how certain positions feel better on a fundamental level? / The Golden Rule"</h3>
<p>Ahh the Golden Rule, or Golden Ratio, or Phi. It doesn't matter how you
put it, using this ratio can drastically improve how your user perceives
your work. Anyone who is a fan of The DaVinci Code will know what Phi
is, but for those who don't let me elaborate: Phi is pretty. Though
there is a bazillion things you can read to explain Phi and its many,
many uses (see below) the concept is simple: The human body has many
instances of applicable Phi (ratios all over the place) and so people
have theorized that because of this we then intemperate this ratio as
being naturally 'good'.</p>
<p>What does this mean? In the most basic sense, using this ratio in your
design will make it more pleasing to the end user. Now granted that if
you use light gray text and tartan backdrop that shifts through the
color spectrum, all the golden rule you apply wont take away the pain.</p>
<p>There are many good examples of how the golden rule has been applied
throughout the ages, just go ahead and <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;q=Golden+Ratio&amp;btnG=Search&amp;meta=" title="Google">search
it</a>.
I can wait. See what I mean? If you didn't search for it you'll have to
take my word for it.</p>

<h3 id="buzzword">"or how to make photos more dynamic?"</h3>
<p>This one's a bit of a cop-out since "dynamic photos" is really bordering
on buzzword territory. What I was implying was simply "do you know how
to make your photos as good as they can be?" Unless you've been doing
photography for a long time like <a href="http://www.taylorjacksonphoto.com/" title="Taylor Jackson Photography">my
friend</a>,
you probably do not know that much about how to take good photos. Hell,
you're happy if your point and shoot manages not to blur the photo most
of the time. There are many ways you can improve your shots but I won't
bother listing them.</p>

<h3 id="end">When Does it all End?</h3>
<p><em>Short answer</em>: never.</p>
<p><em>Long answer</em>: sometime between never, and never ever. If you are
willing to dispute that fact, then either you don't believe me, or you
feel you have indeed seen the end of your design education. If you feel
that you have in fact learned everything there is to learn about design,
then why are you reading this? I'm no help to you, as you are no longer
willing to learn.</p>
<p>You see, it can't end. Mankind evolves, and as it does so will our ways
to express ourselves. We'll never be out of the job, though our tools
will change. If you have stopped learning you have stopped trying. It
really is as simple as that. You may find it harder to find new things
to learn, and that's almost excusable and all I can say is that you will
just need to look harder.</p>
<p>It's that drive that keeps people creating.</p>
