So I ended up seeing this movie a bit at the last minute. That is to
say, Theresa told me about it, then told me that she was seeing it with
her friend at a time that allowed little error in me driving 1.5 hours
to get to the theater. I arrived with about 6 minutes to spare, and
though it probably cost me a mint in gas (not to mention the 10 dollar
movie ticket \[ damn you indie film support\]), I am glad to say that it
was worth every penny

Weber, [500 Days of
Summer](http://www.foxsearchlight.com/500daysofsummer/ "Fox Searchlight: 500 Days of Summer")
is shockingly not about global warming. No, the story revolves around
two people: Tom Hansen (played by the under-rated [Joseph
Gordon-Levitt](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0330687/ "IMDB: Joseph Gordon-Levitt"))
and Summer Finn (played by equally under-rated [Zooey
Deschanel](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0221046/ "IMDB: Zooey Deschanel")).
Two people who met almost by chance, talked, dated, broke up, met again,
and all the highs and lows that happen throughout.

Tom works at a greeting card company, where he thinks up slogans for the
company, and prototypes cards. Summer comes into the company as the
bosses new assistant. Though Tom tries to fight it, he is drawn to
Summer for reasons he can't explain. You see Tom has always believed in
"the one" and felt quite certain that Summer was it. Summer on the other
hand doesn't really believe in boyfriends or any of that "fate" stuff.

Tom falls in love.

Summer doesn't.

Within the first five minutes, you are introduced to every major
character, and thrown right into the darkest part of the film. 2 minutes
after that, you are thrown into the lightest part. It's almost
mind-boggling, but it holds itself together beautifully.

What I Liked
------------

I am a huge fan of how this film was shot. amazingly simple yet strong
shots really helped bring home. simple things like Tom on the Bus,
freaking out about the song on his iPod, to he and Summer sitting in the
Diner at the start of the movie, to the single best example of a movie
breaking into a full-out choreographed song and dance number. Everything
about the filmography had me, director Marc Webb does nothing less than
stellar in the direction of this movie. The transitioning between scenes
gave it an almost Tarantino feel, except for you know what the hell is
going on. I loved the subtle use of colours and foliage changing that
was a small foreshadow of how the next scene was going to play out.

I loved loved loved the use of typography in this movie. Now sadly, I'm
not so much of a typophile to be able to tell you what font specifically
was used, but I know it's one I've seen, and it worked so very well for
this movie. The transitioning between days was made that much better by
the simple numeric counter that was featured (in said font, of course).

And lets not forget the music. From the Smiths to Feist, this movie
ranges all over the place. What really impressed me though was how well
the music actually went with each scene. Some of the musical choices
might have been considered a little out of the way, but they really
helped bring in the subtly of feeling that the audience needed. The
soundtrack to this movie will be getting into my iTunes one way or the
other, I can assure you of that.

I'm also going to give a shout out to whoever built the sets and/or
found the locations to do the shots. There are some stunning locations
in that movie. So much so that it made me want to crawl into the movie
just so I could look around in wonder.

What I Disliked
---------------

Though I love [Matthew Gray
Gubler](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1693763/ "IMDB: Matthew Gray Gubler"),
his use in this movie was woefully contrived. He was quite literally
"the friend" that you needed to fill in scenes or to say specific lines.
His character, though enjoyable, was one-dimensional, and little was
done to really add to it. His one moving line was too little too late to
save the character.

The ending. Or, at least I should say the near ending. When Tom and
Summer meet up and talk about what's happened to them, I felt a little
annoyed that Tom let Summer get off so lightly. Maybe I'm just a bitter
person, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't have been as big of a
man.

Oh wait, yes, the actual ending. I don't want to spoil anything here,
but the name choice at the end of the film. Really? You actually went
for that? Not even the least bit ashamed at the contrived selection? No?
Well you should be.

Overall
-------

I am a big fan of this movie. I may even pick up the DVD and add it to
my very small pile of "DVDs I Can Be Snobby About Because I Love Them So
Much" That's right, I have that pile, and I am snobby about the movies
in it. Don't get me started on Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,
we'll be here for a while.

If you haven't seen it, it's worth the drive and the money. I would
know, as I am a semi-extreme case. It's funny, it's emotional, it's
simple yet complex. It's everything I wanted out of a movie, and it was
delivered to me in spades.

P.S. Thank you 500 Days of Summer for not using Hand-drawn block text
for your movie. There seems to be a trend with indie films and that
damned font-face.

8.5/10
