            <p>So It's been a while since I wrote anything I felt was applicable to
whoring to 9rules, and so when I did go back to their site I had the
shock of finding out that
<a href="http://www.9rules.com/" title="9rules - The best content from the independant web.">9rules</a>
had changed. Drastically changed. At first I didn't even know what I was
looking at. Things had changed so drastically, I didn't know where to
start.</p>
<h3>What happened?</h3>
<p>First of all, they went through a drastic re-design which I am, for the
most part, a fan of. The problem with this is that they changed it all
so much I was utterly lost as to where to go. A better Idea could have
been to have a transitional layout to let ...</p>

takes place in a post-unification, 1984-esque world where the entire
earth is ruled by a corrupt bureaucracy, and there is a clear separation
between the upper class and the rest of the world. It's a grungy
Cyberpunk story where no one in the slums should live past the age of
22, everyone drinks tub gin, and bullets are as common as smells.</p>
<p>Our anti-hero, Avery Cates, is a gunner: a gun for higher, assassin, hit
man, or all-around kill-for-cash sort of dude. He's 27 and doesn't know

<p>This is pretty straightforward people. <em>Know when you need to deliver</em>
things by (milestones, project builds, documents, etc) and make sure
they're delivered by that date/time. When things start slipping from the
timeline, then it just compounds as one section runs into another.
Believe me when I say that there is only so much overlap you can
orchestrate before something breaks. Think Jenga.</p>
<p>On that same note, make sure that your time requirements are accurate. I
cannot stress that enough. If you think something should only take you
an hour, give yourself 2. If you end up ahead of schedule, great! You've
just created buffer time for when something ...</p>
