So where to begin? I've started school, though it's only frosh week so
that doesn't count. I'm liking [Mohawk
College](http://www.mohawkcollege.ca/homepage.html "Mohawk Collge") more
than [Conestoga](http://www.conestogac.on.ca/ "Conestoga College") in
terms of the faculty. Not that
[Conestoga](http://www.conestogac.on.ca/ "Conestoga College")'s was bad,
but the staff at
[Mohawk](http://www.mohawkcollege.ca/homepage.html "Mohawk Collge")
really seem to give a damn. These teachers actually seem to want to help
me out, especially since I've been working on switching from one stream
to another. The campus (Brantford - Elgin) feels like a high school for
grown ups - I said the same about
[Conestoga](http://www.conestogac.on.ca/ "Conestoga College") - and I've
come to the decision that colleges must look like bigger high schools.
Only Universities can have shiny arty architecture, and nice stuff.

All that aside, I think I'm going to enjoy my two years at
[Mohawk](http://www.mohawkcollege.ca/homepage.html "Mohawk Collge").
They've already done a far better job making me like them than
[Conestoga](http://www.conestogac.on.ca/ "Conestoga College") *ever*
did. We'll see how I feel y the end of the two years, but if they keep
this up I'll be a happy camper.

To segue into something totally unrelated I'm rocking the [Avenue Q
soundtrack](http://sonybmgmasterworks.com/artistsites/avenueq/index.html "Avenue Q soundtrack")
pretty hard right now. If people have a chance to see this in theaters,
please for the love of all that is sacred and pure, do so. It's so
god-damned fantastic that words fail to articulate how amazing the show
is. Full of rough humor, puppets, and topics that land impressively
close to home, it's worth every penny. **Listen to it.**

SUBJECT CHANGE.

I've been doing some small changes around the website, if anyone has
noticed. One change I've made is that my suggested reading is now being
powered by [Goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com/ "Goodreads"). I've made
a [shelf for my
favorites](http://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1198481?shelf=favorites "Goodreads: Corey Dutsons favorites")
on [Goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com/ "Goodreads") and by parsing the
RSS feed (thank you Wordpress) I've got my newest 10 constantly updating
from the list. Saves me repeating effort, and ups my 2.0 web
[ePenis](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ePenis "Urban Dictionary: ePenis")
a notch.

I've also made the colour switcher a bit more obvious. The for squares
in the top left corner of the layout actually do more than just look
damned pretty. They actually change the colour scheme of the website.
Apparently I'm the only person that actually knew this. I was sort of
happy to have it be an easter egg for the site, but after some
consideration I've opted to make it more obvious so someone other than
me can enjoy it as well.

Feel free to click them at random. They are cookie-enabled so if you're
rocking cookies in your browser(s) my site will remember the preference
and keep your color preference. It's somewhat pointless, but there it
is.

I've also got my
[resumé](/resume/ "WallOfScribbles: Resumé of Corey Dutson")page up and
running if anyone wants to take a look at that. Much like my current
layout, it is a completely grid-designed, and I went for maximum
contrast so there's very little in terms of colours.

To end off this utterly random post, I'll mention that today I bought a
Wacom Bamboo. It's pretty and black and I'm a fan of having a mouse and
a pen to choose from. Having said that, I feel like such a stereotype by
buying it and being in a Graphic Design program. It's just so typical;
all i need now is some black-rimmed glasses and a wicked designer beard.

It took me way too long to write this. I'm getting rather distracted
tonight. Honestly, this took me hours. There's no excuse for that. Well
not a valid one.
