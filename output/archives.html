unfortunate reality that the time I had with my XBox 360 was quickly
drawing to a close. As such, I wanted to make sure I got through a
couple of my unfinished games before getting rid of the lovely thing.
I'm taking the harddrive back home with me, so it's only a temporary

<p>Risk is hard; it is an unforgiving mistress.</p>
<p>Risk should only be played with people you already hate, or with people
whom you will learn to forgive, and they you. Risk is the destroyer of
people, friendships, and nations alike. Risk sorts out the winners from
the losers; the strong from the weak.</p>
<p>I love Risk, but there's a problem: Risk takes a long time, and usually
devolves into

expedite the whole thing? And why not add alcohol into the mix?</p>

<p>Pretty much everyone who played the first Portal has been chomping at
the bit for a sequel of sorts to come around. That being said, Portal
was a bit of a sleeper hit (and meme generator). It took a while for it
to become popular. It took even longer for for it to become popular to
release on its own. It did, of course, and I've been the proud owner of
